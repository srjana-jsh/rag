It helped Amazon stock soar\\n\\ninto four-digit territory, and the company\\'s earnings reports often delighted\\n\\ninvestors.\\n\\nNow, after a year of troubling earnings reports, Amazon has launched a major\\n\\nrestructuring, including plans to cut 27,000 employees from its workforce. Is\\n\\nAmazon stock a buy?\\n\\nIn late March, Amazon announced plans to slash 9,000 jobs. That\\'s on top of the\\n\\n18,000 job cuts it announced in January.\\n\\n\"Given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in\\n\\nthe near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and head\\n\\ncount,\" Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in a written notice to employees\\n\\nwhen the layoffs were announced. He also suggested more layoffs are possible. The\\n\\ncuts mainly focus on Amazon Web Services, advertising, Twitch, human resources\\n\\nand its stores divisions.\\n\\nAmazon Jumps Into Arti\\x00cial Intelligence\\n\\nOn April 13, Amazon jumped into the booming \\x00eld of generative arti\\x00cial\\n\\nintelligence, the technology behind ChatGPT. Amazon stock climbed on the news,\\n\\nas did other AI companies.\\n\\nAlphabet and Microsoft (MSFT) previously announced plans to bring ChatGPT to\\n\\nthe public. Meanwhile, Amazon\\'s cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services,\\n\\nplans to target corporate customers.\\n\\nAWS will also expand access to custom-made chips. They say the chips can run AI\\n\\nsoftware more ef\\x00ciently and cheaper than competitors can.\\n\\n\"Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades. But\\n\\nit\\'s only been the last \\x00ve to 10 years that it\\'s started to be used more pervasively\\n\\nby companies,\" Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in his letter to shareholders.\\n\\nMachine learning is a form of arti\\x00cial intelligence.\\n\\nJassy went on to say: \"We will continue to invest substantially in these models\\n\\nacross all of our consumer, seller, brand and creator experience.\"\\n\\nThe three largest cloud computing companies, AWS, Microsoft and Google, have\\n\\nmoved AI development to the top of their to-do list. Each is trying to capitalize on\\n\\nthe booming interest in arti\\x00cial intelligence technology.\\n\\nA Heightened Focus On Cost Savings\\n\\nAfter the second round of job cuts, Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA,\\n\\nmaintained a buy rating on Amazon stock.\\n\\n\"While some may view these job cuts as a sign of a gloomier macro outlook,\\n\\nespecially as it relates to cloud computing and digital advertising, we believe\\n\\ninvestors will appreciate Amazon\\'s heightened focus on cost savings and free cash\\n\\n\\x00ow,\" Sundaram wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nThe most recent layoff announcements, in March, came after Amazon announced\\n\\nfourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. The company beat on revenue but missed on\\n\\nearnings, as its typically strong cloud computing unit failed to rescue the e-\\n\\ncommerce giant.\\n\\nThe cloud unit showed that revenue decelerated. AWS sales jumped 20% to $21.4\\n\\nbillion, but that was below expectations and a deceleration from 27% growth in the\\n\\nprior quarter\\n\\nOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said more cost-cutting efforts are needed.\\n\\n\"We believe more layoffs are necessary for e-commerce to become meaningfully\\n\\npro\\x00table,\" he said in his note to clients.\\n\\nAmazon Continues Push Into Health Care\\n\\nIn late February, Amazon completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical,\\n\\ngiving it a primary health care provider with in-person and virtual treatment as well\\n\\nas lab tests and programs for preventive care.\\n\\n\"We\\'re on a mission to make it dramatically easier for people to \\x00nd, choose, afford\\n\\nand engage with the services, products, and professionals they need to get and stay\\n\\nhealthy,\" said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, in a\\n\\nwritten statement with the Amazon news release.\\n\\nAmazon has made several forays into the health care market. In 2018 Amazon paid\\n\\nabout $1 billion to acquire PillPack. That gave Amazon the ability to ship\\n\\nprescriptions around the country, making it a direct threat to the more than $400\\n\\nbillion pharmacy business.\\n\\nAmazon has long-held ambitions to greatly simplify how consumers receive health\\n\\ncare, but it remains a lofty goal that has yet to emerge as a moneymaking venture.\\n\\nTechnical Analysis Of Amazon Stock\\n\\nIn the stock market, timing is critical. So when you\\'re looking for stocks to buy or\\n\\nsell, it\\'s important to do the fundamental and technical analysis that identi\\x00es\\n\\nlower-risk entry points that also offer solid potential rewards.\\n\\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that Amazon stock has a weak IBD Composite\\n\\nRating of 36 out of 99. When choosing growth stocks for the biggest potential,\\n\\nbased on technical and fundamental criteria, try to focus on those with a\\n\\nComposite Rating of 90 or higher.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s Relative Strength Rating now stands at 32 out of 99. Ideally, look for\\n\\nstocks with a rating of 80 or higher.\\n\\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy?\\n\\nAMZN is not a buy at this time. It\\'s still in a long-term downtrend but has been\\n\\nrecovering since it hit a low at the start of the year.\\n\\nAMZN stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price\\n\\naction is so far pretty smooth.\\n\\nEven if Amazon breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could\\n\\nretard any advance AMZN tries in the next several months.\\n\\nThe stock continues to hit resistance at the 200-day line, which has been a\\n\\nresistance level for about a year. Amazon is currently sitting on its 50-day line.\\n\\nFalling below that would be reason for caution. But holding above it and then\\n\\npiercing through the 200-day line and holding would be a positive sign.\\n\\nRecognizing stock chart patterns is one key to the investment guidelines.

Still, many\\n\\ninvestors might be wondering if AAPL stock is a buy right now.\\n\\nApple Stock News: iPhone 14 Sales\\n\\nApple introduced its third-generation 5G smartphones, the iPhone 14 series, on\\n\\nSept. 7. It also debuted its Apple Watch Series 8 smartwatches and second-\\n\\ngeneration AirPods Pro wireless earbuds. Apple stock rose 0.9% on the news.\\n\\nAnalysts praised the innovative new devices but some worried that the premium\\n\\nproducts would be a tough sell in the current economic climate.\\n\\nHowever, demand for the high-end iPhone 14 Pro models has been strong, while\\n\\nsales of the regular models have disappointed.\\n\\nCovid-related production disruptions in China signi\\x00cantly impacted iPhone supply\\n\\nand sales in the December quarter. But Apple was able to capture much of those\\n\\nmissed sales in the March quarter, executives said.\\n\\nApple now is preparing for the launch of its iPhone 15 smartphone lineup this\\n\\nSeptember.\\n\\nApple Opportunities For Growth\\n\\nWith the iPhone business maturing, investors are wondering what the next big\\n\\ngrowth driver will be for Apple stock.\\n\\nRecently, two businesses have given Apple\\'s sales and pro\\x00ts a boost: services and\\n\\nwearables.\\n\\nIn the March quarter, Apple\\'s services revenue increased 5% year over year to\\n\\n$20.9 billion. Meanwhile, its hardware sales declined 5% to $73.9 billion. Services\\n\\ninclude the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple\\n\\nArcade and other offerings.\\n\\nIn late October, Apple raised prices for the \\x00rst time on its Apple Music and Apple\\n\\nTV+ services. It also hiked the price for its Apple One services bundle.\\n\\nIn late March, Barclays analyst Tim Long said Apple\\'s advertising business is\\n\\n\"underappreciated\" by investors.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple is facing antitrust scrutiny in the U.S., Europe and Asia for its\\n\\nApp Store policies, including its 30% commission fee.\\n\\nApple Product Rumors Persist\\n\\nApple\\'s Wearables, Home and Accessories unit saw sales dip a fraction to $8.8\\n\\nbillion in the March quarter. This unit includes wearables like the Apple Watch,\\n\\nAirPods wireless earbuds and Beats headphones. It also contains the Apple\\n\\nHomePod wireless speaker and other miscellaneous gadgets.\\n\\nNews leaks suggest that Apple will announce a headset for virtual reality and\\n\\naugmented reality in 2023. The computer headset could be a driver of Apple stock,\\n\\nanalysts say. But many are skeptical about prospects for the mixed-reality goggles,\\n\\nwhich reportedly will cost about $3,000.\\n\\nMeanwhile, speculation continues that Apple is looking to make a self-driving\\n\\nelectric car.\\n\\nApple Earnings: Beat and Guide Down\\n\\nLate on May 4, Apple topped Wall Street\\'s targets for its \\x00scal second quarter and\\n\\nguided lower for the current period. Apple stock rose on the news in the next\\n\\ntrading session.\\n\\nApple earned $1.52 a share on sales of $94.8 billion for the quarter ended April 1.\\n\\nAnalysts polled by FactSet had predicted Apple earnings of $1.43 a share on sales of\\n\\n$92.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Apple earnings were unchanged while sales\\n\\nfell 2.5%. It was the second consecutive quarter of sales declines for Apple.\\n\\nFor the June quarter, Apple forecast sales to decline 2.5% year over year, vs. Wall\\n\\nStreet\\'s estimate for an increase of 1.8%\\n\\nIn the March quarter, Apple\\'s iPhone revenue increased 2% to $51.3 billion, topping\\n\\nanalyst estimates. Smartphones accounted for 54% of the company\\'s total sales in\\n\\nthe period.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple\\'s Mac computer sales tumbled 31% to $7.2 billion. Apple\\'s iPad\\n\\nsales declined 13% to $6.7 billion. And revenue from Apple\\'s wearables, home and\\n\\naccessories unit fell a fraction to $8.8 billion.\\n\\nThe company\\'s next earnings report is likely to happen in late July or early August.\\n\\nThat could be a catalyst for Apple stock.\\n\\nApple Stock Retreats From Record High\\n\\nIn January 2022, Apple hit a market value of $3 trillion when its shares reached\\n\\n182.86. It was the \\x00rst company to reach a market capitalization of $3 trillion.\\n\\nIt notched a record high of 182.94 before pulling back. AAPL stock trended lower in\\n\\nthe weeks that followed and it attempted to rally several times last year.\\n\\nApple\\'s Storied History\\n\\nApple has been an American success story several times over. First, it ignited the\\n\\npersonal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II.

Analysts expected pro\\x00ts to edge up\\n\\naround 4% to 80 cents per share with revenue totaling $24.22 billion, up 43%\\n\\ncompared with last year.\\n\\nTesla\\'s total gross pro\\x00t grew 7% to $4.53 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile,\\n\\ntotal gross margins came in at 18.2%, down from 19.3% in Q1 and a decline of 682\\n\\nbasis points vs. last year. Auto gross margins, excluding regulatory credits and\\n\\nleases, came in at 18.1%, down from 18.3% in Q1.\\n\\nThat is below the 20% gross margin \"\\x00oor\" Tesla previously targeted. Ahead of\\n\\nearnings, a slew of analysts rang warning bells on gross margins.\\n\\n\"The short-term variances in gross margins and pro\\x00tability really are minor\\n\\nrelative to the long term picture,\" Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors during\\n\\nthe Q2 earnings call.\\n\\n\"Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly,\" he added.\\n\\nStock Falls After Earnings\\n\\nHowever on July 20, TSLA tumbled 9.7% to 262.90, falling below the 21-day line\\n\\nbut only giving up July gains.\\n\\nAhead of earnings, Wood sold tranches of her \\x00rm\\'s Tesla stock holdings in\\n\\nconsecutive sessions, unloading more than 73,000 shares before the EV giant\\n\\nreported second-quarter \\x00nancials.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas on July 24 wrote he expects Tesla\\'s full-year\\n\\nauto gross margins to remain below 20% until 2025.\\n\\nCathie Wood sold another 20,700 shares of Tesla stock on July 25 for around $5.49\\n\\nmillion, based on the closing price of 265.28.\\n\\nTesla Stock And Musk\\n\\nThere is never a dull moment for Tesla and Musk, with the two inextricably linked.\\n\\nSince Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 28, purchasing the social media platform for\\n\\n$44 billion, some longtime Tesla stock bulls have worried Musk\\'s focus on Twitter,\\n\\nalong with negative attention, is weighing down Tesla stock.\\n\\nMusk appeared to lessen those fears when he hired Linda Yaccarino,\\n\\nNBCUniversal\\'s advertising chief, as the new CEO for X Corp., formerly known as\\n\\nTwitter. The Tesla chief added Yaccarino will focus on business operations while he\\n\\nwill work on product design and new technology.\\n\\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote the news ends some of the \"distraction risk\\n\\naround the Tesla story.\"\\n\\nWith TSLA shares pulling back after earnings, the top question for investors is\\n\\nalways, when is it a good time to buy or sell Tesla stock.\\n\\nTesla and Musk are betting big on the Cybertruck and autonomous vehicle\\n\\ntechnology, along with a possible tailwind from the In\\x00ation Reduction Act (IRA).\\n\\nTesla A Monster Stock Over Much Of Its History\\n\\nAlmost single-handedly, Musk has turned the auto industry on its head, essentially\\n\\nforcing it to get aboard the electric-vehicle train.\\n\\nIt\\'s a reason why Tesla has been a monster stock over much of its history, especially\\n\\nduring its stratospheric run from mid-2019 to late 2021. The stock hit a bear\\n\\nmarket low of 101.84 on Jan. 6, but roared back until Q1 earnings.\\n\\nOn April 19, Tesla reported a big \\x00rst-quarter earnings decline while revenue\\n\\nmissed views. Pro\\x00t margins for the global EV giant also fell below 20% as the\\n\\ncompany executed an aggressive price-slashing strategy in the \\x00rst part of 2023.\\n\\nTesla reported revenue increasing 24% to $23.33 billion with EPS of 85 cents, a\\n\\n20% decline compared to 2022.\\n\\nThe EV company\\'s total gross pro\\x00t came in at $4.5 billion, with Tesla\\'s pro\\x00t gross\\n\\nmargin at 19.3%, down from 23.8% in Q4 and 29.1% a year earlier.\\n\\nTesla\\'s Global Price Cutting Strategy\\n\\nTesla has slashed prices worldwide multiple times in 2023, starting in January and\\n\\ncontinuing into April. The only exception is China, where Tesla cut prices\\n\\nsigni\\x00cantly in late October before the reductions in early January.\\n\\nOn April 14, Tesla reduced prices in several European markets. Tesla also dropped\\n\\nthe price of its electric vehicles in Israel and Singapore in order to increase demand,\\n\\nexpanding a worldwide discount push that began in China in January.\\n\\nThe global EV maker also signi\\x00cantly reduced prices in the U.S. and Europe on Jan.\\n\\n13, then reduced European prices again in early March.\\n\\nIn Germany, Tesla lowered the price of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by between\\n\\n4.5% and 9.8%, while it cut prices of the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Singapore\\n\\nbetween 4.3% and 5%.\\n\\nHowever, more recently Tesla raised Model S and Model X vehicle prices in China\\n\\nby around $2,750.

The global EV giant also increased prices on its two popular vehicles in\\n\\nother markets including the U.S.\\n\\nTesla Stock: Betting On Autonomous Vehicles And The Cybertruck\\n\\nMusk has long touted Tesla\\'s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and the potential\\n\\nvalue it brings to the brand.\\n\\nThe Tesla CEO told investors during the Q1 earnings call the \"value of a car that is\\n\\nautonomous is enormous.\"\\n\\nMusk also stressed that improvements in the FSD beta are \"really quite dramatic.\"\\n\\n\"The trend is very clearly toward full autonomy, and I hesitate to say this, but I think\\n\\nwe\\'ll do it this year,\" Musk said, referring to self-driving vehicles.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Musk has con\\x00rmed that a Cybertruck delivery event will take place\\n\\nlater in 2023.\\n\\nTesla reported in its Q2 \\x00nancials the Cybertruck \"remains on track to begin initial\\n\\nproduction later this year at Gigafactory Texas.\" However, the EV giant added it is\\n\\n\"testing Cybertruck vehicles around the world for \\x00nal certi\\x00cation and validation.\"\\n\\n\"We can\\'t wait to start delivering it later this year,\" Musk told investors Wednesday,\\n\\nreferring to the Cybertruck.\\n\\nOn July 15, Tesla tweeted a photo of the \\x00rst Tesla Cybertruck made at its Austin\\n\\nplant. Tesla stock responded jumping 3.2%.\\n\\nThe company also said it continues to \"make progress\" on its next generation\\n\\nplatform.

The company expects to ramp production over the next year\\n\\nand aims to deliver 50,000 units in 2024.\\n\\nBefore the recall, PepsiCo planned to deploy 36 Tesla Semi trucks, with 15 in\\n\\nModesto and 21 in Sacramento.\\n\\nPepsi placed its order for 100 EVs when the Semi was \\x00rst announced in 2017.\\n\\nTesla is currently under investigation by National Highway Traf\\x00c Safety\\n\\nAdministration over possible seat belt failures.

       " Document(page_content='NEWS\\n\\nIs Meta Stock Still A Buy After Facebook Parent Surges On Earnings, Outlook?\\n\\nJED GRAHAM 07:00 AM ET 07/29/2023\\n\\nM eta Platforms (META) continued to rally strongly in Friday stock market\\n\\naction, maintaining momentum after soundly beating Q2 earnings estimates late\\n\\nWednesday. Meta added an exclamation point with its much-stronger-than-\\n\\nexpected sales outlook for Q3. The turnaround for Meta stock has come in waves,\\n\\nas the parent of Instagram and Facebook progressed from multiple rounds of\\n\\nlayoffs and cost cuts to renewed revenue growth to excitement over generative AI\\'s\\n\\npotential to provide a long-term sales and pro\\x00t boost.\\n\\nX\\n\\nIs Meta Stock A Buy?\\n\\nMeta stock has now rallied 170% so far in 2023, second only to Nvidia (NVDA) in\\n\\nthe S&P 500. Investors have good reason to be excited about the outlook, and there\\n\\nare some potential near-term catalysts that might continue to fuel Meta stock. The\\n\\ncompany is hosting a Sept. 27 conference to reveal more about its AI and metaverse\\n\\ninitiatives. The event will feature the launch of Meta\\'s new Quest 3 mixed reality\\n\\nheadset.\\n\\nThe launch of the Threads text-based social media site to capitalize on Twitter\\n\\nturmoil seized the spotlight in early July by racking up more than 100-million sign-\\n\\nups in the \\x00rst week. But that gave way to doubt whether people would stick\\n\\naround. Now that Meta has belatedly begun rolling out basic features that Twitter\\n\\nusers take for granted, we may \\x00nd out how serious of a challenge Threads will pose\\n\\nas daily user statistics are updated.\\n\\nStill, it wouldn\\'t be surprising to see Meta stock\\'s fantastic run take a breather.\\n\\nWhile there are de\\x00nitely reasons to be excited about the impact of generative AI\\n\\non Meta results, that\\'s more of a long-term story. A closer look at the earnings\\n\\nturnaround also suggests Meta\\'s earnings momentum may be somewhat less than\\n\\nmeets the eye. That\\'s only partly because of ongoing expenses on the metaverse\\n\\nthat won\\'t pay off anytime soon. Regulation also continues to pose risks.\\n\\nMeta stock is trading at an 18-month high, but does not currently have a buy point.\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META)\\n\\n$316.56 5.83 1.88%\\n\\n25\\n\\n09\\n\\n23\\n\\n06\\n\\n20\\n\\n03 Feb\\n\\n17\\n\\n03 Mar\\n\\n17\\n\\n31 Apr\\n\\n14\\n\\n28 May\\n\\n12\\n\\n26\\n\\n09\\n\\n23\\n\\n07\\n\\nDec\\n\\nJan\\n\\nJun\\n\\nJul\\n\\n08/07/2023 (Market Close)\\n\\nMeta Earnings And Outlook\\n\\nThe Menlo Park, Calif.-based social media giant late Wednesday said it earned $2.98\\n\\na share on sales of $32 billion in the June quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had\\n\\nexpected Meta earnings of $2.91 a share on sales of $31.08 billion. On a year-over-\\n\\nyear basis, Meta earnings increased 21% while sales advanced 11%.\\n\\nMeta\\'s second-quarter earnings results broke a streak of six straight quarters of\\n\\nyear-over-year declines. Meanwhile, Meta\\'s revenue rose for the second quarter in\\n\\na row after three straight quarters of declines.\\n\\nThe results re\\x00ected continued user growth in all regions. The number of people\\n\\nusing at least one Meta app on a daily basis rose to 3.07 billion from 3.02 billion in\\n\\nQ1. That includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Facebook daily\\n\\nactive users rose to 2.064 billion from 2.037 billion overall. In the U.S., 202 million\\n\\npeople used Facebook on a daily basis, up from 200 million in Q1.\\n\\nFor the third quarter, Meta predicted revenue of $32 billion to $34.5 billion,\\n\\ngrowing by a range of 15.5% to 24.5%. The midpoint of $33.25 billion was well\\n\\nabove Wall Street\\'s prediction of $31.22 billion.\\n\\nReels Monetization\\n\\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted improving monetization of Reels short-\\n\\nform videos to an annual run rate of over $10 billion in Q2. That compares to a $1-\\n\\nbillion annual run rate a year ago. In other words, on a quarterly basis, Reels ad\\n\\nrevenue accounted for about $2.25 billion of the overall $3.2 billion in revenue\\n\\ngrowth vs. a year ago.\\n\\nThe massive jump in Reels revenue came as the number of short-form videos played\\n\\nacross Facebook and Instagram reached 200 billion per day, up more than 40% from\\n\\n140 billion last fall. That growth is partly because Meta, in a bid to compete against\\n\\nTikTok, has programmed its AI discovery engine that recommends content to users\\n\\nto prioritize Reels videos. As a result, time spent watching Reels videos subtracts to\\n\\nan extent from other activity on Facebook and Instagram. Still, Meta says that part\\n\\nof Reels growth re\\x00ects \"incremental engagement,\" meaning that it is a net\\n\\ncontributor to overall time spent on Meta\\'s apps.\\n\\nYet the biggest reason Reels revenue is rising so fast is that Meta has been taking a\\n\\nwhile to \\x00gure out how to optimize ads on the TikTok competitor it launched in\\n\\n2020. Basically, Meta had been running a lot of ad-free content, sandbagging\\n\\nrevenue. Now, the rising ad load on Reels has provided a one-time jump in ad sales.\\n\\nMeta Regains Its Competitive Edge\\n\\nThe Q3 revenue outlook might give the impression that Meta has returned to fast\\n\\ngrowth, but that seems uncertain.\\n\\nConsider Q3 guidance for year-over-year sales growing by a range of $4.3 billion to\\n\\n$6.8 billion. Meta expects the weaker dollar to provide a 3% tailwind or as much as a\\n\\n$1 billion lift. The higher ad load alone on Reels could provide a boost of about $1.5\\n\\nbillion.\\n\\nOn top of that, CFO Susan Li noted that revenue declined 4.5% in the year-ago\\n\\nquarter. \"We\\'re really lapping a much-weaker demand period a year ago.\"\\n\\nLi credited \"improvement in the macroeconomic landscape\" as a big factor in Q3\\n\\nguidance. She highlighted \"stabilization\" in key advertiser segments like online\\n\\ncommerce and gaming.\\n\\nAnother part of Meta\\'s turnaround story involves overcoming the industry\\n\\nupheaval caused by Apple\\'s privacy change. Starting with the iOS 14.5 update in the\\n\\nspring of 2021, Apple began requiring apps downloaded through the App Store to\\n\\nlet users opt in or out of tracking their activity across third-party sites. With the\\n\\nbulk of users opting out, Meta lost the data needed to help businesses narrowly\\n\\ntarget advertising to consumers likely to have an interest in their products or\\n\\nservices.\\n\\nIn February 2022, Meta revealed just how big of a revenue hit Apple\\'s privacy shift\\n\\nwould deliver: $10 billion in 2022 alone, amounting to about $2.5 billion per\\n\\nquarter.\\n\\nThe good news is that Meta seems to have come a long way in rebuilding its\\n\\nadvertising edge, partly by substituting user data with AI and automation.\\n\\nJoin IBD Live And Learn Top Chart-Reading And Trading Techniques From The\\n\\nPros\\n\\nMeta Growth Avenues\\n\\nA big part of the Meta growth story is the ongoing shift to digital advertising, which\\n\\ngrew 5.5% from a year earlier in Q2 vs. 2% for the ad market across all media,\\n\\naccording to a July 13 Deutsche Bank note.\\n\\nBusiness messaging is another growth area. Click-to-message ads, which open up a\\n\\nWhatsApp or Messenger chat with businesses, have reached a $10-billion annual\\n\\nrate, Zuckerberg said on the Q4 call. In the latest call, he noted that the number of\\n\\nbusinesses using paid messaging products has doubled from a year ago.\\n\\nZuckerberg sees generative AI as a major impetus for improving — and monetizing\\n\\n— business communications.\\n\\nOne of the biggest issues limiting monetization of business messaging is that \"it\\'s\\n\\nquite human labor-intensive,\" so Meta\\'s click-to-message ads have taken off where\\n\\nthe cost of labor is relatively low. But in a world where every business has an AI\\n\\nagent, \"the kind of success that we\\'re seeing in Thailand or Vietnam with business\\n\\nmessaging could kind of spread everywhere,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The two technological waves that we\\'re riding are AI in the near term and the\\n\\nmetaverse over the long term,\" Zuckerberg said.\\n\\n\"There are 1 billion or 2 billion people who have glasses today. I think in the future,\\n\\nthey\\'re all going to be smart glasses,\" essentially wearable computers. He also\\n\\npredicted that \"all the time that we spend on TVs and computers, I think that\\'s going\\n\\nto get more immersive and look something more like VR (virtual reality) in the\\n\\nfuture.\"\\n\\nThreads is a wild card. It could become Meta\\'s \"\\x00fth great app,\" Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nThe goal now is to build the Threads community so there are hundreds of millions of\\n\\npeople using it at a high rate. \"Then we\\'ll worry about monetization.\"\\n\\nMeta Worries\\n\\nDespite Meta\\'s resurgence, the company won\\'t shed its new \"year of ef\\x00ciency\"\\n\\nethos, Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nStill, its Reality Labs division focused on the metaverse and smart-glasses\\n\\nopportunity lost $3.7 billion in Q2. And Meta said it expects year-over-year losses\\n\\nto rise in 2023 and to grow \"meaningfully\" again in 2024.\\n\\nRegulation is the other main worry. Meta was hit with a $1.3 billion \\x00ne in Q2 for\\n\\nviolating the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation by transmitting\\n\\ndata on EU citizens to the U.S.\\n\\n\"We continue to see increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and U.S.,\"\\n\\nLi said. \"The adoption of guidelines that require penalties to be assessed on a\\n\\npercentage of global revenue\" is of particular concern.\\n\\nMeta has yet to launch Threads in the EU due to regulatory issues.\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META)\\n\\n$316.56 5.83 1.88%\\n\\nDec 20\\n\\nMar 21\\n\\nJun 21\\n\\nSep 21\\n\\nDec 21\\n\\nMar 22\\n\\nJun 22\\n\\nSep 22\\n\\nDec 22\\n\\nMar 23\\n\\nJu\\n\\n08/07/2023 (Market Close)\\n\\nMeta Stock\\n\\nIn Friday stock market action, Meta stock climbed 4.4% to 325.48.

       " Document(page_content='New to Investors.com?\\n\\nStart here!\\n\\nTECHNOLOGY\\n\\nIs Google Stock A Buy As AI Investments Aim To Drive Ad, Cloud Growth?\\n\\nREINHARDT KRAUSE 09:30 AM ET 08/05/2023\\n\\nA mid a possible bubble in arti\\x00cial intelligence stocks, is the valuation of\\n\\nGoogle-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) a worry? Not if rising AI investments for GOOGL\\n\\nstock yield improved advertising and cloud computing growth, analysts say.\\n\\nthat could be ﬂashing\\n\\nthis leadership potential.\\n\\n00:27 / 06:39\\n\\nDespite mounting competition in arti\\x00cial intelligence and internet search, Google\\n\\nstock has advanced 46% this year. That\\'s better than the 34.6% jump in the Nasdaq\\n\\ncomposite. One worry is that investor appetite for AI stocks could drive a market\\n\\nmelt-up.\\n\\nAlphabet reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations\\n\\namid rising investments in arti\\x00cial intelligence. With 19% earnings growth in the\\n\\nJune period, Google stock ended a four-quarter string of year-over-year declines.\\n\\nIn addition, the company said Chief Financial Of\\x00cer Ruth Porat will assume the\\n\\nnewly created role of President and Chief Investment Of\\x00cer effective Sept. 1.\\n\\nPorat will continue to serve as CFO through the 2024 capital planning process as\\n\\nthe company \\x00nds a successor.\\n\\nOne concern for GOOGL stock is new competition in internet search.\\n\\nGOOGL Stock: AI Battle Rages\\n\\nGoogle aims to counter Microsoft\\'s (MSFT) investment in arti\\x00cial intelligence\\n\\nstartup OpenAI by making its own generative AI tools available to software\\n\\ndevelopers. One big question is whether integrating chatbot AI technology into\\n\\nsearch queries will lower Google pro\\x00t margins.\\n\\n\"While Microsoft and OpenAI were \\x00rst to introduce text-generative AI with\\n\\nChatGPT, we note that Google has been using large language/AI models to enhance\\n\\nsearch results for users and enable smart bidding for advertisers,\" Truist analyst\\n\\nYoussef Squali said in a note to clients.\\n\\nHe added: \"To better compete on the enterprise software side, Alphabet is\\n\\nintegrating AI into its Cloud offering, providing tools and APIs for developers,\\n\\ncreators and partners to help grow their businesses. Also, Google is integrating AI\\n\\ninto Gmail and Docs.\"\\n\\nAt the Google I/O 2023 developers event on May 10, Alphabet showcased how\\n\\ngenerative AI will be integrated into search, maps, Workspace, photos, cloud\\n\\ncomputing and Android devices. Google discussed how advertising will evolve as\\n\\ngenerative AI is added to search.\\n\\nAt Google Marketing Live on May 23, Alphabet announced AI tools to allow\\n\\nadvertisers to essentially synthesize a unique text or display ad, in real time, based\\n\\non the user\\'s query and advertiser data supplied to Google.\\n\\nGoogle Stock: Pichai Pay Jumps\\n\\nGoogle\\'s board of directors has authorized an additional $70 billion in stock\\n\\nrepurchases. In the \\x00rst quarter, the company repurchased $14.6 billion of its own\\n\\nstock.\\n\\nAccording to JP Morgan, Alphabet has been increasing its stage in GitLab (GTLB).\\n\\nGoogle Ventures in May bought $19.7 million of GTLB shares. Google Ventures and\\n\\nAlphabet now own 3.4% of GitLab, which offers software programmers an open\\n\\nsource app development platform.\\n\\nAmid pressure to cut expenses, Alphabet disclosed that Chief Executive Sundar\\n\\nPichai\\'s pay jumped to $226 million in 2022, due to a big stock award.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Alphabet has stepped up cost cutting.\\n\\nGoogle stock on Jan. 20 said it will cut 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its global\\n\\nworkforce, adding to a growing wave of layoffs among U.S. technology companies.\\n\\nThe layoffs follow a hiring spree at the company.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice on Jan. 24 \\x00led antitrust charges against Google,\\n\\nleaving open the question of whether the search giant will have to divest some of its\\n\\nad business in order to satisfy regulators. The DOJ claims Google\\'s dominance in\\n\\ndigital advertising harms competition.\\n\\nGOOGL Stock: Justice Department Files Suit\\n\\nThe lawsuit marks the DOJ\\'s second antitrust case versus the internet giant in just\\n\\nover two years. The DOJ in October 2020 \\x00led an antitrust lawsuit charging that\\n\\nGoogle has monopolized internet search and search-related advertising. That case\\n\\nis scheduled to go to trial in September.\\n\\nYouTube Chief Executive Susan Wojcicki in February announced her departure. She\\n\\nwas replaced by long-time YouTuber Neal Mohan.\\n\\nMeanwhile, lawmakers and courts are closing in on fundamental changes to Section\\n\\n230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law has shielded internet companies\\n\\nfrom liability for content on their sites for nearly three decades.\\n\\nThe internet giant completed a 20-for-1 split for shares of Google-parent Alphabet\\n\\nafter the market close on July 15 2022.\\n\\nIn the long run, however, the GOOGL stock split could pave the way for the tech\\n\\ngiant to enter the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Google stock could be more\\n\\nattractive to retail investors.\\n\\nDue to its huge cash holdings, Google stock has shrugged off three \\x00nes totaling\\n\\n$9.3 billion levied by the European Union on antitrust grounds.\\n\\nBoosting Ad Business Through E-Commerce\\n\\nAlphabet aims to boost its advertising business through e-commerce-related\\n\\ninternet search. At the same time, it hopes to chip away at Amazon.com\\'s (AMZN)\\n\\ndominance in product search.\\n\\nGoogle\\'s internet search business will hold up better than other advertising\\n\\nformats, such as social media, analysts say.\\n\\nGoogle has rolled out the Performance Max advertising platform. It automates\\n\\nbuying across YouTube, internet search, display, Gmail, maps and other applications.\\n\\nPerformance Max lets advertisers manage campaigns across all Google ad\\n\\ninventory. Advertisers that use the tools convert more shoppers into buyers,\\n\\nGoogle says.\\n\\nThe big picture: Google stock this year faces more dif\\x00cult year-over-year growth\\n\\ncomparisons in 2023 as the coronavirus emergency fades.\\n\\nIn a near-term boost for its advertising business, Google has delayed phasing out\\n\\ninternet cookies to 2024. Also, in early 2022, Alphabet said it expected a\\n\\n\"meaningful increase\" in 2022 capital spending, re\\x00ecting investments in computer\\n\\nservers in internet data centers and construction of of\\x00ce space.\\n\\nGoogle Stock: Arti\\x00cial Intelligence Prowess\\n\\nMost investors still know the company as Google, even though the internet search\\n\\ngiant reorganized as holding company Alphabet in 2015. The restructuring move\\n\\nseparated Google\\'s core internet advertising business from so-called moonshots,\\n\\nsuch as autonomous vehicles and the Verily Life Sciences unit.\\n\\nIn March 2022, Google spun off its quantum computing technology group as a\\n\\nseparate company.\\n\\nGoogle stock\\'s strength in arti\\x00cial intelligence spans digital advertising, the Google\\n\\nCloud Platform, YouTube and consumer hardware products. GOOGL stock is just\\n\\none arti\\x00cial intelligence stock to watch.\\n\\nAt a Google developers conference in mid-May, the company demonstrated how it\\n\\nuses AI tools in a wide range of applications, including Google Workspace, Google\\n\\nMaps, virtual reality, and voice-based search.\\n\\nAfter a long run, GOOGL stock has dropped out of the IBD Leaderboard. The\\n\\nLeaderboard is IBD\\'s curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and\\n\\nfundamental metrics.\\n\\nBig Tech Stocks Face Regulatory Headwinds\\n\\nWith the Android mobile operating system built into devices sold worldwide, the\\n\\nPlay Store has been a revenue growth driver.\\n\\nA federal judge ruled in September 2021 that Apple (AAPL) must allow mobile app\\n\\ndevelopers to steer consumers to outside payment methods. Google\\'s policies also\\n\\nare under scrutiny.\\n\\nGoogle in 2021 said service fees at its Play Store would drop to 15% from 30%. The\\n\\nmove reduced revenue.\\n\\nUnder Pichai, Google has improved transparency. Google began disclosing cloud\\n\\ncomputing \\x00nancial metrics with its fourth-quarter report in \\x00scal 2020. But the\\n\\ncloud business has yet to turn a pro\\x00t. And YouTube\\'s pro\\x00tability still remains a\\n\\nmystery.\\n\\nGoogle Stock Fundamentals\\n\\nGoogle earnings for the June quarter came in at $1.44 a share, up 19%, as operating\\n\\nmargins expanded for the \\x00rst time since the fourth quarter of 2021.\\n\\nThe company said gross revenue rose 7% to $74.60 billion, compared with $69.7\\n\\nbillion a year ago. Analysts had predicted Google earnings of $1.34 per share on\\n\\nrevenue of $72.84 billion.\\n\\nCapital spending in the second quarter rose to $6.9 billion, up from $6.3 billion in\\n\\nthe \\x00rst quarter. Further, Google repurchased $14.97 billion of its own stock during\\n\\nthe period.\\n\\nAlso, advertising revenue rose 3% to $58.14 billion vs. estimates of $57.39 billion.\\n\\nMeanwhile, YouTube ad revenue rose 4% to $7.66 billion during the second quarter.\\n\\nAnalysts had estimated YouTube ad revenue of $7.42 billion. Google said cloud\\n\\ncomputing revenue rose 28% to $8.03 billion vs. estimates of $7.87 billion.\\n\\nWaymo Autonomous Vehicle Business\\n\\nA key question for investors is how much should Google\\'s self-driving-car project\\n\\nWaymo and \"Other Bets\" such as the Verily Life Sciences unit \\x00gure into valuation.\\n\\nIn early 2018, some Google stock analysts projected Waymo\\'s long-term valuation\\n\\nin a range of anywhere from $75 billion to $125 billion. Expectations for\\n\\nautonomous vehicles, though, have been sharply lowered.\\n\\nWaymo in 2021 raised $2.25 billion in funding from outside investors. including\\n\\nprivate equity \\x00rm Silver Lake, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Abu\\n\\nDhabi\\'s Mubadala investment arm.\\n\\nWhile Google did not disclose Waymo\\'s valuation in the funding round, reports said\\n\\nit was only $30 billion. It could be lower now.\\n\\nGoogle Stock: Cloud, Hardware, Security Acquisitions\\n\\nAnother question is the performance of Google\\'s hardware business. It\\'s battling\\n\\nApple in smartphones and Amazon in smart-home appliances.\\n\\nAlso, Google\\'s acquisition of smartwatch maker Fitbit closed in January 2022. The\\n\\n$2.1 billion purchase should help Google make a push into the health and \\x00tness\\n\\nmarket, analysts say.\\n\\nGoogle\\'s cloud computing business, meanwhile, faces tough rivals in Amazon and\\n\\nMicrosoft. Google brought in Thomas Kurian, a former Oracle (ORCL) executive, to\\n\\nimprove performance in the corporate market.\\n\\nBulls say Google Cloud Platform is taking share as it focuses on security, open\\n\\nsource software and data analytics.\\n\\nIn 2019, Google purchased data analytics \\x00rm Looker for $2.6 billion in cash. Santa\\n\\nCruz, Calif.-based Looker\\'s analytics platform uses business intelligence and data\\n\\nvisualization tools.\\n\\nMore acquisitions to boost Google\\'s cloud business could be coming, analysts say.\\n\\nGoogle acquired cybersecurity \\x00rm Mandiant (MNDT) for $23 per share in an all-\\n\\ncash $5.4 billion deal.\\n\\nGoogle Stock: Is It A Buy Now?\\n\\nGOOGL stock jumped 65% in 2021. But in 2022 Google shares dropped 39%.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Google\\'s Relative Strength Rating stands at 89 out of a best-possible\\n\\n99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of\\n\\n80 or better.\\n\\nGoogle stock owns an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That rating analyzes\\n\\nprice and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading.\\n\\nFurther, shares hold an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. The best growth\\n\\nstocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\\n\\nAs of Aug. 4, Google stock holds a 127.10 buy point from a cup-with-handle base.\\n\\nGOOGL stock trades in a 5% buy zone that extends to 133.45.\\n\\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on arti\\x00cial\\n\\nintelligence, cybersecurity and 5G wireless.\\n\\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\\n\\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD\\'s Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\\n\\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD\\'s ETF Market Strategy\\n\\nHow To Use The 10-Week Moving Average For Buying And Selling\\n\\nGet Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech Report | How To Invest\\n\\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSmith Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens', metadata={'source': '/Users/rachitjoshi/Documents/Finbot/notebooks/../data/pdfs/google_investorcom_1.pdf'})]"
