The\\n\\ncompany is hosting a Sept. 27 conference to reveal more about its AI and metaverse\\n\\ninitiatives. The event will feature the launch of Meta's new Quest 3 mixed reality\\n\\nheadset.\\n\\nThe launch of the Threads text-based social media site to capitalize on Twitter\\n\\nturmoil seized the spotlight in early July by racking up more than 100-million sign-\\n\\nups in the \\u0000rst week. But that gave way to doubt whether people would stick\\n\\naround. Now that Meta has belatedly begun rolling out basic features that Twitter\\n\\nusers take for granted, we may \\u0000nd out how serious of a challenge Threads will pose\\n\\nas daily user statistics are updated.\\n\\nStill, it wouldn't be surprising to see Meta stock's fantastic run take a breather.\\n\\nWhile there are de\\u0000nitely reasons to be excited about the impact of generative AI\\n\\non Meta results, that's more of a long-term story. A closer look at the earnings\\n\\nturnaround also suggests Meta's earnings momentum may be somewhat less than\\n\\nmeets the eye. That's only partly because of ongoing expenses on the metaverse\\n\\nthat won't pay off anytime soon. Regulation also continues to pose risks.\\n\\nMeta stock is trading at an 18-month high, but does not currently have a buy point.\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META)\\n\\n$316.56 5.83 1.88%\\n\\n25\\n\\n09\\n\\n23\\n\\n06\\n\\n20\\n\\n03 Feb\\n\\n17\\n\\n03 Mar\\n\\n17\\n\\n31 Apr\\n\\n14\\n\\n28 May\\n\\n12\\n\\n26\\n\\n09\\n\\n23\\n\\n07\\n\\nDec\\n\\nJan\\n\\nJun\\n\\nJul\\n\\n08/07/2023 (Market Close)\\n\\nMeta Earnings And Outlook\\n\\nThe Menlo Park, Calif.-based social media giant late Wednesday said it earned $2.98\\n\\na share on sales of $32 billion in the June quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had\\n\\nexpected Meta earnings of $2.91 a share on sales of $31.08 billion. On a year-over-\\n\\nyear basis, Meta earnings increased 21% while sales advanced 11%.\\n\\nMeta's second-quarter earnings results broke a streak of six straight quarters of\\n\\nyear-over-year declines. Meanwhile, Meta's revenue rose for the second quarter in\\n\\na row after three straight quarters of declines.\\n\\nThe results re\\u0000ected continued user growth in all regions. The number of people\\n\\nusing at least one Meta app on a daily basis rose to 3.07 billion from 3.02 billion in\\n\\nQ1. That includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Facebook daily\\n\\nactive users rose to 2.064 billion from 2.037 billion overall. In the U.S., 202 million\\n\\npeople used Facebook on a daily basis, up from 200 million in Q1.\\n\\nFor the third quarter, Meta predicted revenue of $32 billion to $34.5 billion,\\n\\ngrowing by a range of 15.5% to 24.5%. The midpoint of $33.25 billion was well\\n\\nabove Wall Street's prediction of $31.22 billion.\\n\\nReels Monetization\\n\\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted improving monetization of Reels short-\\n\\nform videos to an annual run rate of over $10 billion in Q2. That compares to a $1-\\n\\nbillion annual run rate a year ago. In other words, on a quarterly basis, Reels ad\\n\\nrevenue accounted for about $2.25 billion of the overall $3.2 billion in revenue\\n\\ngrowth vs. a year ago.\\n\\nThe massive jump in Reels revenue came as the number of short-form videos played\\n\\nacross Facebook and Instagram reached 200 billion per day, up more than 40% from\\n\\n140 billion last fall. That growth is partly because Meta, in a bid to compete against\\n\\nTikTok, has programmed its AI discovery engine that recommends content to users\\n\\nto prioritize Reels videos. As a result, time spent watching Reels videos subtracts to\\n\\nan extent from other activity on Facebook and Instagram. Still, Meta says that part\\n\\nof Reels growth re\\u0000ects \\\"incremental engagement,\\\" meaning that it is a net\\n\\ncontributor to overall time spent on Meta's apps.\\n\\nYet the biggest reason Reels revenue is rising so fast is that Meta has been taking a\\n\\nwhile to \\u0000gure out how to optimize ads on the TikTok competitor it launched in\\n\\n2020. Basically, Meta had been running a lot of ad-free content, sandbagging\\n\\nrevenue. Now, the rising ad load on Reels has provided a one-time jump in ad sales.\\n\\nMeta Regains Its Competitive Edge\\n\\nThe Q3 revenue outlook might give the impression that Meta has returned to fast\\n\\ngrowth, but that seems uncertain.\\n\\nConsider Q3 guidance for year-over-year sales growing by a range of $4.3 billion to\\n\\n$6.8 billion. Meta expects the weaker dollar to provide a 3% tailwind or as much as a\\n\\n$1 billion lift. The higher ad load alone on Reels could provide a boost of about $1.5\\n\\nbillion.\\n\\nOn top of that, CFO Susan Li noted that revenue declined 4.5% in the year-ago\\n\\nquarter. \\\"We're really lapping a much-weaker demand period a year ago.\\\"\\n\\nLi credited \\\"improvement in the macroeconomic landscape\\\" as a big factor in Q3\\n\\nguidance. She highlighted \\\"stabilization\\\" in key advertiser segments like online\\n\\ncommerce and gaming.\\n\\nAnother part of Meta's turnaround story involves overcoming the industry\\n\\nupheaval caused by Apple's privacy change. Starting with the iOS 14.5 update in the\\n\\nspring of 2021, Apple began requiring apps downloaded through the App Store to\\n\\nlet users opt in or out of tracking their activity across third-party sites. With the\\n\\nbulk of users opting out, Meta lost the data needed to help businesses narrowly\\n\\ntarget advertising to consumers likely to have an interest in their products or\\n\\nservices.\\n\\nIn February 2022, Meta revealed just how big of a revenue hit Apple's privacy shift\\n\\nwould deliver: $10 billion in 2022 alone, amounting to about $2.5 billion per\\n\\nquarter.\\n\\nThe good news is that Meta seems to have come a long way in rebuilding its\\n\\nadvertising edge, partly by substituting user data with AI and automation.\\n\\nJoin IBD Live And Learn Top Chart-Reading And Trading Techniques From The\\n\\nPros\\n\\nMeta Growth Avenues\\n\\nA big part of the Meta growth story is the ongoing shift to digital advertising, which\\n\\ngrew 5.5% from a year earlier in Q2 vs. 2% for the ad market across all media,\\n\\naccording to a July 13 Deutsche Bank note.\\n\\nBusiness messaging is another growth area. Click-to-message ads, which open up a\\n\\nWhatsApp or Messenger chat with businesses, have reached a $10-billion annual\\n\\nrate, Zuckerberg said on the Q4 call. In the latest call, he noted that the number of\\n\\nbusinesses using paid messaging products has doubled from a year ago.\\n\\nZuckerberg sees generative AI as a major impetus for improving — and monetizing\\n\\n— business communications.\\n\\nOne of the biggest issues limiting monetization of business messaging is that \\\"it's\\n\\nquite human labor-intensive,\\\" so Meta's click-to-message ads have taken off where\\n\\nthe cost of labor is relatively low. But in a world where every business has an AI\\n\\nagent, \\\"the kind of success that we're seeing in Thailand or Vietnam with business\\n\\nmessaging could kind of spread everywhere,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"The two technological waves that we're riding are AI in the near term and the\\n\\nmetaverse over the long term,\\\" Zuckerberg said.\\n\\n\\\"There are 1 billion or 2 billion people who have glasses today. I think in the future,\\n\\nthey're all going to be smart glasses,\\\" essentially wearable computers. He also\\n\\npredicted that \\\"all the time that we spend on TVs and computers, I think that's going\\n\\nto get more immersive and look something more like VR (virtual reality) in the\\n\\nfuture.\\\"\\n\\nThreads is a wild card. It could become Meta's \\\"\\u0000fth great app,\\\" Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nThe goal now is to build the Threads community so there are hundreds of millions of\\n\\npeople using it at a high rate. \\\"Then we'll worry about monetization.\\\"\\n\\nMeta Worries\\n\\nDespite Meta's resurgence, the company won't shed its new \\\"year of ef\\u0000ciency\\\"\\n\\nethos, Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nStill, its Reality Labs division focused on the metaverse and smart-glasses\\n\\nopportunity lost $3.7 billion in Q2. And Meta said it expects year-over-year losses\\n\\nto rise in 2023 and to grow \\\"meaningfully\\\" again in 2024.\\n\\nRegulation is the other main worry. Meta was hit with a $1.3 billion \\u0000ne in Q2 for\\n\\nviolating the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation by transmitting\\n\\ndata on EU citizens to the U.S.\\n\\n\\\"We continue to see increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and U.S.,\\\"\\n\\nLi said. \\\"The adoption of guidelines that require penalties to be assessed on a\\n\\npercentage of global revenue\\\" is of particular concern.\\n\\nMeta has yet to launch Threads in the EU due to regulatory issues.\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META)\\n\\n$316.56 5.83 1.88%\\n\\nDec 20\\n\\nMar 21\\n\\nJun 21\\n\\nSep 21\\n\\nDec 21\\n\\nMar 22\\n\\nJun 22\\n\\nSep 22\\n\\nDec 22\\n\\nMar 23\\n\\nJu\\n\\n08/07/2023 (Market Close)\\n\\nMeta Stock\\n\\nIn Friday stock market action, Meta stock climbed 4.4% to 325.48. That matched\\n\\nThursday's 4.4% post-earnings gain.

A weekly chart shows Meta stock pulling\\n\\nback to just above its 50-day line just ahead of its big earnings report on\\n\\nWednesday.\\n\\nYet now Meta is well above its 50-day moving average and it would be too risky to\\n\\nchase.\\n\\nBottom Line: Meta stock has come nearly full circle.

It helped Amazon stock soar\\n\\ninto four-digit territory, and the company's earnings reports often delighted\\n\\ninvestors.\\n\\nNow, after a year of troubling earnings reports, Amazon has launched a major\\n\\nrestructuring, including plans to cut 27,000 employees from its workforce. Is\\n\\nAmazon stock a buy?\\n\\nIn late March, Amazon announced plans to slash 9,000 jobs. That's on top of the\\n\\n18,000 job cuts it announced in January.\\n\\n\\\"Given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in\\n\\nthe near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and head\\n\\ncount,\\\" Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in a written notice to employees\\n\\nwhen the layoffs were announced. He also suggested more layoffs are possible. The\\n\\ncuts mainly focus on Amazon Web Services, advertising, Twitch, human resources\\n\\nand its stores divisions.\\n\\nAmazon Jumps Into Arti\\u0000cial Intelligence\\n\\nOn April 13, Amazon jumped into the booming \\u0000eld of generative arti\\u0000cial\\n\\nintelligence, the technology behind ChatGPT. Amazon stock climbed on the news,\\n\\nas did other AI companies.\\n\\nAlphabet and Microsoft (MSFT) previously announced plans to bring ChatGPT to\\n\\nthe public. Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services,\\n\\nplans to target corporate customers.\\n\\nAWS will also expand access to custom-made chips. They say the chips can run AI\\n\\nsoftware more ef\\u0000ciently and cheaper than competitors can.\\n\\n\\\"Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades. But\\n\\nit's only been the last \\u0000ve to 10 years that it's started to be used more pervasively\\n\\nby companies,\\\" Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in his letter to shareholders.\\n\\nMachine learning is a form of arti\\u0000cial intelligence.\\n\\nJassy went on to say: \\\"We will continue to invest substantially in these models\\n\\nacross all of our consumer, seller, brand and creator experience.\\\"\\n\\nThe three largest cloud computing companies, AWS, Microsoft and Google, have\\n\\nmoved AI development to the top of their to-do list. Each is trying to capitalize on\\n\\nthe booming interest in arti\\u0000cial intelligence technology.\\n\\nA Heightened Focus On Cost Savings\\n\\nAfter the second round of job cuts, Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA,\\n\\nmaintained a buy rating on Amazon stock.\\n\\n\\\"While some may view these job cuts as a sign of a gloomier macro outlook,\\n\\nespecially as it relates to cloud computing and digital advertising, we believe\\n\\ninvestors will appreciate Amazon's heightened focus on cost savings and free cash\\n\\n\\u0000ow,\\\" Sundaram wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nThe most recent layoff announcements, in March, came after Amazon announced\\n\\nfourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. The company beat on revenue but missed on\\n\\nearnings, as its typically strong cloud computing unit failed to rescue the e-\\n\\ncommerce giant.\\n\\nThe cloud unit showed that revenue decelerated. AWS sales jumped 20% to $21.4\\n\\nbillion, but that was below expectations and a deceleration from 27% growth in the\\n\\nprior quarter\\n\\nOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said more cost-cutting efforts are needed.\\n\\n\\\"We believe more layoffs are necessary for e-commerce to become meaningfully\\n\\npro\\u0000table,\\\" he said in his note to clients.\\n\\nAmazon Continues Push Into Health Care\\n\\nIn late February, Amazon completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical,\\n\\ngiving it a primary health care provider with in-person and virtual treatment as well\\n\\nas lab tests and programs for preventive care.\\n\\n\\\"We're on a mission to make it dramatically easier for people to \\u0000nd, choose, afford\\n\\nand engage with the services, products, and professionals they need to get and stay\\n\\nhealthy,\\\" said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, in a\\n\\nwritten statement with the Amazon news release.\\n\\nAmazon has made several forays into the health care market. In 2018 Amazon paid\\n\\nabout $1 billion to acquire PillPack. That gave Amazon the ability to ship\\n\\nprescriptions around the country, making it a direct threat to the more than $400\\n\\nbillion pharmacy business.\\n\\nAmazon has long-held ambitions to greatly simplify how consumers receive health\\n\\ncare, but it remains a lofty goal that has yet to emerge as a moneymaking venture.\\n\\nTechnical Analysis Of Amazon Stock\\n\\nIn the stock market, timing is critical. So when you're looking for stocks to buy or\\n\\nsell, it's important to do the fundamental and technical analysis that identi\\u0000es\\n\\nlower-risk entry points that also offer solid potential rewards.\\n\\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that Amazon stock has a weak IBD Composite\\n\\nRating of 36 out of 99. When choosing growth stocks for the biggest potential,\\n\\nbased on technical and fundamental criteria, try to focus on those with a\\n\\nComposite Rating of 90 or higher.\\n\\nAmazon's Relative Strength Rating now stands at 32 out of 99. Ideally, look for\\n\\nstocks with a rating of 80 or higher.\\n\\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy?\\n\\nAMZN is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been\\n\\nrecovering since it hit a low at the start of the year.\\n\\nAMZN stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price\\n\\naction is so far pretty smooth.\\n\\nEven if Amazon breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could\\n\\nretard any advance AMZN tries in the next several months.\\n\\nThe stock continues to hit resistance at the 200-day line, which has been a\\n\\nresistance level for about a year. Amazon is currently sitting on its 50-day line.\\n\\nFalling below that would be reason for caution. But holding above it and then\\n\\npiercing through the 200-day line and holding would be a positive sign.\\n\\nRecognizing stock chart patterns is one key to the investment guidelines.

Meta added an exclamation point with its much-stronger-than-\\n\\nexpected sales outlook for Q3. The turnaround for Meta stock has come in waves,\\n\\nas the parent of Instagram and Facebook progressed from multiple rounds of\\n\\nlayoffs and cost cuts to renewed revenue growth to excitement over generative AI's\\n\\npotential to provide a long-term sales and pro\\u0000t boost.\\n\\nX\\n\\nIs Meta Stock A Buy?\\n\\nMeta stock has now rallied 170% so far in 2023, second only to Nvidia (NVDA) in\\n\\nthe S&P 500. Investors have good reason to be excited about the outlook, and there\\n\\nare some potential near-term catalysts that might continue to fuel Meta stock. The\\n\\ncompany is hosting a Sept. 27 conference to reveal more about its AI and metaverse\\n\\ninitiatives. The event will feature the launch of Meta's new Quest 3 mixed reality\\n\\nheadset.\\n\\nThe launch of the Threads text-based social media site to capitalize on Twitter\\n\\nturmoil seized the spotlight in early July by racking up more than 100-million sign-\\n\\nups in the \\u0000rst week. But that gave way to doubt whether people would stick\\n\\naround. Now that Meta has belatedly begun rolling out basic features that Twitter\\n\\nusers take for granted, we may \\u0000nd out how serious of a challenge Threads will pose\\n\\nas daily user statistics are updated.\\n\\nStill, it wouldn't be surprising to see Meta stock's fantastic run take a breather.\\n\\nWhile there are de\\u0000nitely reasons to be excited about the impact of generative AI\\n\\non Meta results, that's more of a long-term story. A closer look at the earnings\\n\\nturnaround also suggests Meta's earnings momentum may be somewhat less than\\n\\nmeets the eye. That's only partly because of ongoing expenses on the metaverse\\n\\nthat won't pay off anytime soon. Regulation also continues to pose risks.\\n\\nMeta stock is trading at an 18-month high, but does not currently have a buy point.\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META)\\n\\n$316.56 5.83 1.88%\\n\\n25\\n\\n09\\n\\n23\\n\\n06\\n\\n20\\n\\n03 Feb\\n\\n17\\n\\n03 Mar\\n\\n17\\n\\n31 Apr\\n\\n14\\n\\n28 May\\n\\n12\\n\\n26\\n\\n09\\n\\n23\\n\\n07\\n\\nDec\\n\\nJan\\n\\nJun\\n\\nJul\\n\\n08/07/2023 (Market Close)\\n\\nMeta Earnings And Outlook\\n\\nThe Menlo Park, Calif.-based social media giant late Wednesday said it earned $2.98\\n\\na share on sales of $32 billion in the June quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had\\n\\nexpected Meta earnings of $2.91 a share on sales of $31.08 billion. On a year-over-\\n\\nyear basis, Meta earnings increased 21% while sales advanced 11%.\\n\\nMeta's second-quarter earnings results broke a streak of six straight quarters of\\n\\nyear-over-year declines. Meanwhile, Meta's revenue rose for the second quarter in\\n\\na row after three straight quarters of declines.\\n\\nThe results re\\u0000ected continued user growth in all regions. The number of people\\n\\nusing at least one Meta app on a daily basis rose to 3.07 billion from 3.02 billion in\\n\\nQ1. That includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Facebook daily\\n\\nactive users rose to 2.064 billion from 2.037 billion overall. In the U.S., 202 million\\n\\npeople used Facebook on a daily basis, up from 200 million in Q1.\\n\\nFor the third quarter, Meta predicted revenue of $32 billion to $34.5 billion,\\n\\ngrowing by a range of 15.5% to 24.5%. The midpoint of $33.25 billion was well\\n\\nabove Wall Street's prediction of $31.22 billion.\\n\\nReels Monetization\\n\\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted improving monetization of Reels short-\\n\\nform videos to an annual run rate of over $10 billion in Q2. That compares to a $1-\\n\\nbillion annual run rate a year ago. In other words, on a quarterly basis, Reels ad\\n\\nrevenue accounted for about $2.25 billion of the overall $3.2 billion in revenue\\n\\ngrowth vs. a year ago.\\n\\nThe massive jump in Reels revenue came as the number of short-form videos played\\n\\nacross Facebook and Instagram reached 200 billion per day, up more than 40% from\\n\\n140 billion last fall. That growth is partly because Meta, in a bid to compete against\\n\\nTikTok, has programmed its AI discovery engine that recommends content to users\\n\\nto prioritize Reels videos. As a result, time spent watching Reels videos subtracts to\\n\\nan extent from other activity on Facebook and Instagram. Still, Meta says that part\\n\\nof Reels growth re\\u0000ects \\\"incremental engagement,\\\" meaning that it is a net\\n\\ncontributor to overall time spent on Meta's apps.\\n\\nYet the biggest reason Reels revenue is rising so fast is that Meta has been taking a\\n\\nwhile to \\u0000gure out how to optimize ads on the TikTok competitor it launched in\\n\\n2020. Basically, Meta had been running a lot of ad-free content, sandbagging\\n\\nrevenue. Now, the rising ad load on Reels has provided a one-time jump in ad sales.\\n\\nMeta Regains Its Competitive Edge\\n\\nThe Q3 revenue outlook might give the impression that Meta has returned to fast\\n\\ngrowth, but that seems uncertain.\\n\\nConsider Q3 guidance for year-over-year sales growing by a range of $4.3 billion to\\n\\n$6.8 billion. Meta expects the weaker dollar to provide a 3% tailwind or as much as a\\n\\n$1 billion lift. The higher ad load alone on Reels could provide a boost of about $1.5\\n\\nbillion.\\n\\nOn top of that, CFO Susan Li noted that revenue declined 4.5% in the year-ago\\n\\nquarter. \\\"We're really lapping a much-weaker demand period a year ago.\\\"\\n\\nLi credited \\\"improvement in the macroeconomic landscape\\\" as a big factor in Q3\\n\\nguidance. She highlighted \\\"stabilization\\\" in key advertiser segments like online\\n\\ncommerce and gaming.\\n\\nAnother part of Meta's turnaround story involves overcoming the industry\\n\\nupheaval caused by Apple's privacy change. Starting with the iOS 14.5 update in the\\n\\nspring of 2021, Apple began requiring apps downloaded through the App Store to\\n\\nlet users opt in or out of tracking their activity across third-party sites. With the\\n\\nbulk of users opting out, Meta lost the data needed to help businesses narrowly\\n\\ntarget advertising to consumers likely to have an interest in their products or\\n\\nservices.\\n\\nIn February 2022, Meta revealed just how big of a revenue hit Apple's privacy shift\\n\\nwould deliver: $10 billion in 2022 alone, amounting to about $2.5 billion per\\n\\nquarter.\\n\\nThe good news is that Meta seems to have come a long way in rebuilding its\\n\\nadvertising edge, partly by substituting user data with AI and automation.\\n\\nJoin IBD Live And Learn Top Chart-Reading And Trading Techniques From The\\n\\nPros\\n\\nMeta Growth Avenues\\n\\nA big part of the Meta growth story is the ongoing shift to digital advertising, which\\n\\ngrew 5.5% from a year earlier in Q2 vs. 2% for the ad market across all media,\\n\\naccording to a July 13 Deutsche Bank note.\\n\\nBusiness messaging is another growth area. Click-to-message ads, which open up a\\n\\nWhatsApp or Messenger chat with businesses, have reached a $10-billion annual\\n\\nrate, Zuckerberg said on the Q4 call. In the latest call, he noted that the number of\\n\\nbusinesses using paid messaging products has doubled from a year ago.\\n\\nZuckerberg sees generative AI as a major impetus for improving — and monetizing\\n\\n— business communications.\\n\\nOne of the biggest issues limiting monetization of business messaging is that \\\"it's\\n\\nquite human labor-intensive,\\\" so Meta's click-to-message ads have taken off where\\n\\nthe cost of labor is relatively low. But in a world where every business has an AI\\n\\nagent, \\\"the kind of success that we're seeing in Thailand or Vietnam with business\\n\\nmessaging could kind of spread everywhere,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"The two technological waves that we're riding are AI in the near term and the\\n\\nmetaverse over the long term,\\\" Zuckerberg said.\\n\\n\\\"There are 1 billion or 2 billion people who have glasses today. I think in the future,\\n\\nthey're all going to be smart glasses,\\\" essentially wearable computers. He also\\n\\npredicted that \\\"all the time that we spend on TVs and computers, I think that's going\\n\\nto get more immersive and look something more like VR (virtual reality) in the\\n\\nfuture.\\\"\\n\\nThreads is a wild card. It could become Meta's \\\"\\u0000fth great app,\\\" Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nThe goal now is to build the Threads community so there are hundreds of millions of\\n\\npeople using it at a high rate. \\\"Then we'll worry about monetization.\\\"\\n\\nMeta Worries\\n\\nDespite Meta's resurgence, the company won't shed its new \\\"year of ef\\u0000ciency\\\"\\n\\nethos, Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nStill, its Reality Labs division focused on the metaverse and smart-glasses\\n\\nopportunity lost $3.7 billion in Q2. And Meta said it expects year-over-year losses\\n\\nto rise in 2023 and to grow \\\"meaningfully\\\" again in 2024.\\n\\nRegulation is the other main worry. Meta was hit with a $1.3 billion \\u0000ne in Q2 for\\n\\nviolating the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation by transmitting\\n\\ndata on EU citizens to the U.S.\\n\\n\\\"We continue to see increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and U.S.,\\\"\\n\\nLi said. \\\"The adoption of guidelines that require penalties to be assessed on a\\n\\npercentage of global revenue\\\" is of particular concern.\\n\\nMeta has yet to launch Threads in the EU due to regulatory issues.\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META)\\n\\n$316.56 5.83 1.88%\\n\\nDec 20\\n\\nMar 21\\n\\nJun 21\\n\\nSep 21\\n\\nDec 21\\n\\nMar 22\\n\\nJun 22\\n\\nSep 22\\n\\nDec 22\\n\\nMar 23\\n\\nJu\\n\\n08/07/2023 (Market Close)\\n\\nMeta Stock\\n\\nIn Friday stock market action, Meta stock climbed 4.4% to 325.48. That matched\\n\\nThursday's 4.4% post-earnings gain.

Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services,\\n\\nplans to target corporate customers.\\n\\nAWS will also expand access to custom-made chips. They say the chips can run AI\\n\\nsoftware more ef\\u0000ciently and cheaper than competitors can.\\n\\n\\\"Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades. But\\n\\nit's only been the last \\u0000ve to 10 years that it's started to be used more pervasively\\n\\nby companies,\\\" Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in his letter to shareholders.\\n\\nMachine learning is a form of arti\\u0000cial intelligence.\\n\\nJassy went on to say: \\\"We will continue to invest substantially in these models\\n\\nacross all of our consumer, seller, brand and creator experience.\\\"\\n\\nThe three largest cloud computing companies, AWS, Microsoft and Google, have\\n\\nmoved AI development to the top of their to-do list. Each is trying to capitalize on\\n\\nthe booming interest in arti\\u0000cial intelligence technology.\\n\\nA Heightened Focus On Cost Savings\\n\\nAfter the second round of job cuts, Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA,\\n\\nmaintained a buy rating on Amazon stock.\\n\\n\\\"While some may view these job cuts as a sign of a gloomier macro outlook,\\n\\nespecially as it relates to cloud computing and digital advertising, we believe\\n\\ninvestors will appreciate Amazon's heightened focus on cost savings and free cash\\n\\n\\u0000ow,\\\" Sundaram wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nThe most recent layoff announcements, in March, came after Amazon announced\\n\\nfourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. The company beat on revenue but missed on\\n\\nearnings, as its typically strong cloud computing unit failed to rescue the e-\\n\\ncommerce giant.\\n\\nThe cloud unit showed that revenue decelerated. AWS sales jumped 20% to $21.4\\n\\nbillion, but that was below expectations and a deceleration from 27% growth in the\\n\\nprior quarter\\n\\nOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said more cost-cutting efforts are needed.\\n\\n\\\"We believe more layoffs are necessary for e-commerce to become meaningfully\\n\\npro\\u0000table,\\\" he said in his note to clients.\\n\\nAmazon Continues Push Into Health Care\\n\\nIn late February, Amazon completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical,\\n\\ngiving it a primary health care provider with in-person and virtual treatment as well\\n\\nas lab tests and programs for preventive care.\\n\\n\\\"We're on a mission to make it dramatically easier for people to \\u0000nd, choose, afford\\n\\nand engage with the services, products, and professionals they need to get and stay\\n\\nhealthy,\\\" said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, in a\\n\\nwritten statement with the Amazon news release.\\n\\nAmazon has made several forays into the health care market. In 2018 Amazon paid\\n\\nabout $1 billion to acquire PillPack. That gave Amazon the ability to ship\\n\\nprescriptions around the country, making it a direct threat to the more than $400\\n\\nbillion pharmacy business.\\n\\nAmazon has long-held ambitions to greatly simplify how consumers receive health\\n\\ncare, but it remains a lofty goal that has yet to emerge as a moneymaking venture.\\n\\nTechnical Analysis Of Amazon Stock\\n\\nIn the stock market, timing is critical. So when you're looking for stocks to buy or\\n\\nsell, it's important to do the fundamental and technical analysis that identi\\u0000es\\n\\nlower-risk entry points that also offer solid potential rewards.\\n\\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that Amazon stock has a weak IBD Composite\\n\\nRating of 36 out of 99. When choosing growth stocks for the biggest potential,\\n\\nbased on technical and fundamental criteria, try to focus on those with a\\n\\nComposite Rating of 90 or higher.\\n\\nAmazon's Relative Strength Rating now stands at 32 out of 99. Ideally, look for\\n\\nstocks with a rating of 80 or higher.\\n\\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy?\\n\\nAMZN is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been\\n\\nrecovering since it hit a low at the start of the year.\\n\\nAMZN stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price\\n\\naction is so far pretty smooth.\\n\\nEven if Amazon breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could\\n\\nretard any advance AMZN tries in the next several months.\\n\\nThe stock continues to hit resistance at the 200-day line, which has been a\\n\\nresistance level for about a year. Amazon is currently sitting on its 50-day line.\\n\\nFalling below that would be reason for caution. But holding above it and then\\n\\npiercing through the 200-day line and holding would be a positive sign.\\n\\nRecognizing stock chart patterns is one key to the investment guidelines. IBD offers\\n\\na broad range of growth stock lists, such as Leaderboard and SwingTrader.\\n\\nInvestors also can create watchlists, \\u0000nd companies nearing a buy point, or develop\\n\\ncustom screens at IBD MarketSmith.\\n\\nIf you're interested in buying large-cap stocks, in these articles you'll \\u0000nd technical\\n\\nanalysis of leading large caps to see if they are in or near a proper buy zone.\\n\\nPlease follow Brian Deagon on Twitter at @IBD_BDeagon for more on tech stocks,\\n\\nanalysis and \\u0000nancial markets.\\n\\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\\n\\nAmazon Makes Its Swan Dive Into ChatGPT Arti\\u0000cial Intelligence Pool\\n\\nNo Silver Lining In Amazon's Cloud Business As Results Fail To Excite\\n\\nAmazon's Alexa Smart Speaker Blazed A Trail, Then Burned Out\\n\\nLooking For Market Insights?

       "\" \\nTesla stock has been a monster stock over much of its history, especially during its stratospheric run from mid-2019 to late 2021. The stock hit a bear market low of 101.84 on Jan. 6, but roared back until Q1 earnings. Nvidia is seen as one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. Nvidia stock has skyrocketed 206% year to date, after crashing in 2022. Nvidia is a leader in AI chips. In the tech industry's fierce battle for AI dominance, the advanced chips needed for generative AI, such as the ChatGPT chatbot, are key. However, Nvidia stock is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been recovering since it hit a low at the start of the year. Nvidia stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price action is so far pretty smooth. Even if Nvidia breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could retard any advance Nvidia tries in the next several months. Tesla stock is greatly extended from a cup base with a 207.79 buy point. Shares have climbed 118% so far in 2023,\""
