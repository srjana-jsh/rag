      "# Amazon stock is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been recovering since it hit a low at the start of the year. AMZN stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price action is so far pretty smooth. Even if Amazon breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could retard any advance AMZN tries in the next several months. The stock continues to hit resistance at the 200-day line, which has been a resistance level for about a year. Amazon is currently sitting on its 50-day line. Falling below that would be reason for caution. But holding above it and then piercing through the 200-day line and holding would be a positive sign. On the other hand, Meta stock has now rallied 170% so far in 2023, second only to Nvidia (NVDA) in the S&P 500. Investors have good reason to be excited about the outlook, and there are some potential near-term catalysts that might continue to fuel Meta stock. The company is hosting a Sept. 27 conference to reveal more about its AI and metaverse initiatives. The event will feature the launch of Meta's new Quest 3 mixed reality headset. The launch of the Threads text-based social media site to capitalize on Twitter turmoil seized the spotlight in early July by racking up more than 100-million sign-ups in the first week. But that gave way to doubt whether people would stick around. Now that Meta has belatedly begun rolling out basic features that Twitter users take for granted, we may find out how serious of a challenge Threads will pose as daily user statistics are updated. Still, it wouldn't be surprising to see Meta stock's fantastic run take a breather. While there are definitely reasons to be excited about the impact of generative AI on Meta results, that's more of a long-term story. A closer look at the earnings turnaround also suggests Meta's earnings momentum may be somewhat less than meets the eye. That's only partly because of ongoing expenses on the metaverse that won't pay off anytime soon. Regulation also continues to pose risks. Meta stock is trading at an 18-month high, but does not currently have a buy point. Therefore, based on the provided content, you should consider buying Meta stock.<|im_end|>\n"
