      " Amazon stock is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been recovering since it hit a low at the start of the year. AMZN stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price action is so far pretty smooth. Even if Amazon breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could retard any advance AMZN tries in the next several months. The stock continues to hit resistance at the 200-day line, which has been a resistance level for about a year. Amazon is currently sitting on its 50-day line. Falling below that would be reason for caution. But holding above it and then piercing through the 200-day line and holding would be a positive sign. Recognizing stock chart patterns is one key to the investment guidelines. IBD offers a broad range of growth stock lists, such as Leaderboard and SwingTrader. Investors also can create watchlists, find companies nearing a buy point, or develop custom screens at IBD MarketSmith. If you're interested in buying large-cap stocks, in these articles you'll find technical analysis of leading large caps to see if they are in or near a proper buy zone.
