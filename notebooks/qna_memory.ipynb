Analysts expected pro\\u0000ts to edge up\\n\\naround 4% to 80 cents per share with revenue totaling $24.22 billion, up 43%\\n\\ncompared with last year.\\n\\nTesla's total gross pro\\u0000t grew 7% to $4.53 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile,\\n\\ntotal gross margins came in at 18.2%, down from 19.3% in Q1 and a decline of 682\\n\\nbasis points vs. last year. Auto gross margins, excluding regulatory credits and\\n\\nleases, came in at 18.1%, down from 18.3% in Q1.\\n\\nThat is below the 20% gross margin \\\"\\u0000oor\\\" Tesla previously targeted. Ahead of\\n\\nearnings, a slew of analysts rang warning bells on gross margins.\\n\\n\\\"The short-term variances in gross margins and pro\\u0000tability really are minor\\n\\nrelative to the long term picture,\\\" Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors during\\n\\nthe Q2 earnings call.\\n\\n\\\"Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly,\\\" he added.\\n\\nStock Falls After Earnings\\n\\nHowever on July 20, TSLA tumbled 9.7% to 262.90, falling below the 21-day line\\n\\nbut only giving up July gains.\\n\\nAhead of earnings, Wood sold tranches of her \\u0000rm's Tesla stock holdings in\\n\\nconsecutive sessions, unloading more than 73,000 shares before the EV giant\\n\\nreported second-quarter \\u0000nancials.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas on July 24 wrote he expects Tesla's full-year\\n\\nauto gross margins to remain below 20% until 2025.\\n\\nCathie Wood sold another 20,700 shares of Tesla stock on July 25 for around $5.49\\n\\nmillion, based on the closing price of 265.28.\\n\\nTesla Stock And Musk\\n\\nThere is never a dull moment for Tesla and Musk, with the two inextricably linked.\\n\\nSince Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 28, purchasing the social media platform for\\n\\n$44 billion, some longtime Tesla stock bulls have worried Musk's focus on Twitter,\\n\\nalong with negative attention, is weighing down Tesla stock.\\n\\nMusk appeared to lessen those fears when he hired Linda Yaccarino,\\n\\nNBCUniversal's advertising chief, as the new CEO for X Corp., formerly known as\\n\\nTwitter. The Tesla chief added Yaccarino will focus on business operations while he\\n\\nwill work on product design and new technology.\\n\\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote the news ends some of the \\\"distraction risk\\n\\naround the Tesla story.\\\"\\n\\nWith TSLA shares pulling back after earnings, the top question for investors is\\n\\nalways, when is it a good time to buy or sell Tesla stock.\\n\\nTesla and Musk are betting big on the Cybertruck and autonomous vehicle\\n\\ntechnology, along with a possible tailwind from the In\\u0000ation Reduction Act (IRA).\\n\\nTesla A Monster Stock Over Much Of Its History\\n\\nAlmost single-handedly, Musk has turned the auto industry on its head, essentially\\n\\nforcing it to get aboard the electric-vehicle train.\\n\\nIt's a reason why Tesla has been a monster stock over much of its history, especially\\n\\nduring its stratospheric run from mid-2019 to late 2021. The stock hit a bear\\n\\nmarket low of 101.84 on Jan. 6, but roared back until Q1 earnings.\\n\\nOn April 19, Tesla reported a big \\u0000rst-quarter earnings decline while revenue\\n\\nmissed views. Pro\\u0000t margins for the global EV giant also fell below 20% as the\\n\\ncompany executed an aggressive price-slashing strategy in the \\u0000rst part of 2023.\\n\\nTesla reported revenue increasing 24% to $23.33 billion with EPS of 85 cents, a\\n\\n20% decline compared to 2022.\\n\\nThe EV company's total gross pro\\u0000t came in at $4.5 billion, with Tesla's pro\\u0000t gross\\n\\nmargin at 19.3%, down from 23.8% in Q4 and 29.1% a year earlier.\\n\\nTesla's Global Price Cutting Strategy\\n\\nTesla has slashed prices worldwide multiple times in 2023, starting in January and\\n\\ncontinuing into April. The only exception is China, where Tesla cut prices\\n\\nsigni\\u0000cantly in late October before the reductions in early January.\\n\\nOn April 14, Tesla reduced prices in several European markets. Tesla also dropped\\n\\nthe price of its electric vehicles in Israel and Singapore in order to increase demand,\\n\\nexpanding a worldwide discount push that began in China in January.\\n\\nThe global EV maker also signi\\u0000cantly reduced prices in the U.S. and Europe on Jan.\\n\\n13, then reduced European prices again in early March.\\n\\nIn Germany, Tesla lowered the price of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by between\\n\\n4.5% and 9.8%, while it cut prices of the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Singapore\\n\\nbetween 4.3% and 5%.\\n\\nHowever, more recently Tesla raised Model S and Model X vehicle prices in China\\n\\nby around $2,750. That follows a $290 price hike in China on the Model 3 and\\n\\nModel Y. The global EV giant also increased prices on its two popular vehicles in\\n\\nother markets including the U.S.\\n\\nTesla Stock: Betting On Autonomous Vehicles And The Cybertruck\\n\\nMusk has long touted Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and the potential\\n\\nvalue it brings to the brand.\\n\\nThe Tesla CEO told investors during the Q1 earnings call the \\\"value of a car that is\\n\\nautonomous is enormous.\\\"\\n\\nMusk also stressed that improvements in the FSD beta are \\\"really quite dramatic.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The trend is very clearly toward full autonomy, and I hesitate to say this, but I think\\n\\nwe'll do it this year,\\\" Musk said, referring to self-driving vehicles.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Musk has con\\u0000rmed that a Cybertruck delivery event will take place\\n\\nlater in 2023.\\n\\nTesla reported in its Q2 \\u0000nancials the Cybertruck \\\"remains on track to begin initial\\n\\nproduction later this year at Gigafactory Texas.\\\" However, the EV giant added it is\\n\\n\\\"testing Cybertruck vehicles around the world for \\u0000nal certi\\u0000cation and validation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We can't wait to start delivering it later this year,\\\" Musk told investors Wednesday,\\n\\nreferring to the Cybertruck.\\n\\nOn July 15, Tesla tweeted a photo of the \\u0000rst Tesla Cybertruck made at its Austin\\n\\nplant. Tesla stock responded jumping 3.2%.\\n\\nThe company also said it continues to \\\"make progress\\\" on its next generation\\n\\nplatform. Since the Tesla investor day in early March, the company has remained\\n\\nmostly silent on its next generation vehicle, to be produced at its new plant in\\n\\nMexico. At the annual shareholder meeting, Tesla unveiled a vehicle silhouette.\\n\\nThe Long-Awaited Semi Hauler Unveiled\\n\\nIn early December, Tesla unveiled its long-awaited Semi, an 18-wheel, long-haul\\n\\nelectric freight truck, \\u0000ve years after it was \\u0000rst announced. However, in March,\\n\\nTesla ordered a voluntary recall of 35 Semi trucks due to a parking brake issue.\\n\\nTesla began delivering its long-haul Semi trucks to PepsiCo (PEP) in December.\\n\\nFurther, Musk has indicated there are plans to build out a charging network for\\n\\nlong-haul trucks.\\n\\nMusk did not specify how much the eighteen-wheeler costs. The Semi is capable of\\n\\ntraveling an estimated 500 miles per charge. It can accelerate from zero to 60 in 20\\n\\nseconds, Tesla says. The company expects to ramp production over the next year\\n\\nand aims to deliver 50,000 units in 2024.\\n\\nBefore the recall, PepsiCo planned to deploy 36 Tesla Semi trucks, with 15 in\\n\\nModesto and 21 in Sacramento.\\n\\nPepsi placed its order for 100 EVs when the Semi was \\u0000rst announced in 2017.\\n\\nTesla is currently under investigation by National Highway Traf\\u0000c Safety\\n\\nAdministration over possible seat belt failures. Regulators are also probing the EV\\n\\ngiant over steering-wheel issues and driver-assistance concerns.\\n\\nIs Tesla Stock A Buy?\\n\\nTSLA stock is greatly extended from a cup base with a 207.79 buy point. Shares\\n\\nhave climbed 118% so far in 2023, according to Leaderboard analysis. After the\\n\\npullback on Q2 earnings, TSLA is up around 3% in July.\\n\\nNow Tesla is working on a deeper cup base going back to September 2022 with a\\n\\n313.80 buy point.\\n\\nTesla (TSLA)\\n\\n$251.41 2.45 0.97%\\n\\n25\\n\\n09\\n\\n23\\n\\n06\\n\\n20\\n\\n03 Feb\\n\\n17\\n\\n03 Mar\\n\\n17\\n\\n31 Apr\\n\\n14\\n\\n28 May\\n\\n12\\n\\n26\\n\\n09\\n\\n23\\n\\n07\\n\\nDec\\n\\nJan\\n\\nJun\\n\\nJul\\n\\n08/07/2023 (Market Close)\\n\\nTechnically, Tesla now has a handle on a weekly chart, offering 299.29 buy point.\\n\\nBut a slightly deeper pullback or pause could create a meaningful handle. That\\n\\nhandle could end up developing into a new base with the broader consolidation.\\n\\nAn extended handle or new base would offer more time for moving averages to\\n\\ncatch up to the TSLA stock price.\\n\\nTesla stock ranks third in IBD's automaker industry group. It has a 98 Composite\\n\\nRating out of 99. Tesla has a 95 Relative Strength Rating and its EPS Rating is 94\\n\\nout of 99.\\n\\nThe market status is showing a \\\"con\\u0000rmed uptrend.\\\" However, Tesla stock is greatly\\n\\nextended from a cup base and TSLA is not a buy right now.\\n\\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\\n\\nGet An Edge In The Stock Market With IBD Digital\\n\\nLabor Unions Keep The Heat On Starbucks And Amazon\\n\\nTesla Signals IRA Tax Credit Reduction For Model 3\\n\\nFed, Big Earnings Loom; Tesla Downgraded\\n\\nNEWS\\n\\nNvidia More Than Triples In 2023 On AI Boost — Is It A Buy?\\n\\nAPARNA NARAYANAN 03:25 PM ET 08/04/2023\\n\\nN vidia (NVDA), a giant in data centers and gaming, continues to sizzle. The\\n\\nchip giant is seen as one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. Is Nvidia stock a buy\\n\\nright now, with earnings due?\\n\\nSemiconductor, AI News\\n\\nIn May, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang announced a new supercomputer,\\n\\nsoftware and services for generative AI (arti\\u0000cial intelligence). Generative AI can\\n\\ncreate content, including written articles, from simple descriptive phrases by\\n\\nanalyzing and digesting vast amounts of data. It can also write computer\\n\\nprogramming code.\\n\\nFor its latest quarter, graphics-chip maker Nvidia crushed Wall Street's targets on\\n\\nrecord data-center sales. Production is ramping up to meet huge demand for AI\\n\\ntechnology, CEO Huang said.\\n\\nNvidia is a leader in AI chips. In the tech industry's \\u0000erce battle for AI dominance,\\n\\nthe advanced chips needed for generative AI, such as the ChatGPT chatbot, are key.\\n\\nFor those looking for top large-cap stocks to buy now, here's a dive into NVDA\\n\\nstock.\\n\\nNvidia Stock Technical Analysis\\n\\nNvidia rebounded Aug. 3 after three down days, technically regaining a 439.90 buy\\n\\npoint. Shares edged higher on Aug. 4. The latest entry from a three-weeks-tight\\n\\npattern offered a place for existing investors to add a few more shares. The buy\\n\\nrange goes to 461.90, the IBD Leaderboard stock analysis shows.\\n\\nBut with the market rally shifting to under pressure, investors may want to wait to\\n\\nsee if Nvidia can \\u0000nd support at the 50-day/10-week line for the \\u0000rst time since\\n\\nearly January.\\n\\nA rebound from those levels would offer a buying opportunity. But shares aren't\\n\\nthere yet.\\n\\nA further pullback also could be part of a full-\\u0000edged base.\\n\\nShares still aren't far from the 52-week high, set on July 14.\\n\\nNVDA joined the prestigious IBD Leaderboard in February on an earnings gap-up. It\\n\\nsurged again in May on blowout earnings and strong guidance.\\n\\nYear to date, Nvidia stock has skyrocketed 206%, after crashing in 2022.\\n\\nThe relative strength line is \\u0000attening out a bit after a strong rally, the IBD\\n\\nMarketSmith charts show. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the\\n\\nS&P 500. It is the blue line in the chart shown.\\n\\nNVDA earns an IBD Composite Rating of 97, out of a best-possible 99.

It's working on \\\"supercomputers\\\" combining its own CPUs and\\n\\nGPUs.\\n\\nIn addition, Nvidia chips are used for Bitcoin mining and self-driving electric cars.\\n\\nNvidia has made a big push into metaverse applications.\\n\\nFabless chip stocks include Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Monolithic\\n\\nPower Systems (MPWR).\\n\\nCurrently, the fabless group ranks No. 2 out of 197 industry groups.

It helped Amazon stock soar\\n\\ninto four-digit territory, and the company's earnings reports often delighted\\n\\ninvestors.\\n\\nNow, after a year of troubling earnings reports, Amazon has launched a major\\n\\nrestructuring, including plans to cut 27,000 employees from its workforce. Is\\n\\nAmazon stock a buy?\\n\\nIn late March, Amazon announced plans to slash 9,000 jobs. That's on top of the\\n\\n18,000 job cuts it announced in January.\\n\\n\\\"Given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in\\n\\nthe near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and head\\n\\ncount,\\\" Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in a written notice to employees\\n\\nwhen the layoffs were announced. He also suggested more layoffs are possible. The\\n\\ncuts mainly focus on Amazon Web Services, advertising, Twitch, human resources\\n\\nand its stores divisions.\\n\\nAmazon Jumps Into Arti\\u0000cial Intelligence\\n\\nOn April 13, Amazon jumped into the booming \\u0000eld of generative arti\\u0000cial\\n\\nintelligence, the technology behind ChatGPT. Amazon stock climbed on the news,\\n\\nas did other AI companies.\\n\\nAlphabet and Microsoft (MSFT) previously announced plans to bring ChatGPT to\\n\\nthe public. Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services,\\n\\nplans to target corporate customers.\\n\\nAWS will also expand access to custom-made chips. They say the chips can run AI\\n\\nsoftware more ef\\u0000ciently and cheaper than competitors can.\\n\\n\\\"Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades. But\\n\\nit's only been the last \\u0000ve to 10 years that it's started to be used more pervasively\\n\\nby companies,\\\" Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in his letter to shareholders.\\n\\nMachine learning is a form of arti\\u0000cial intelligence.\\n\\nJassy went on to say: \\\"We will continue to invest substantially in these models\\n\\nacross all of our consumer, seller, brand and creator experience.\\\"\\n\\nThe three largest cloud computing companies, AWS, Microsoft and Google, have\\n\\nmoved AI development to the top of their to-do list. Each is trying to capitalize on\\n\\nthe booming interest in arti\\u0000cial intelligence technology.\\n\\nA Heightened Focus On Cost Savings\\n\\nAfter the second round of job cuts, Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA,\\n\\nmaintained a buy rating on Amazon stock.\\n\\n\\\"While some may view these job cuts as a sign of a gloomier macro outlook,\\n\\nespecially as it relates to cloud computing and digital advertising, we believe\\n\\ninvestors will appreciate Amazon's heightened focus on cost savings and free cash\\n\\n\\u0000ow,\\\" Sundaram wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nThe most recent layoff announcements, in March, came after Amazon announced\\n\\nfourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. The company beat on revenue but missed on\\n\\nearnings, as its typically strong cloud computing unit failed to rescue the e-\\n\\ncommerce giant.\\n\\nThe cloud unit showed that revenue decelerated. AWS sales jumped 20% to $21.4\\n\\nbillion, but that was below expectations and a deceleration from 27% growth in the\\n\\nprior quarter\\n\\nOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said more cost-cutting efforts are needed.\\n\\n\\\"We believe more layoffs are necessary for e-commerce to become meaningfully\\n\\npro\\u0000table,\\\" he said in his note to clients.\\n\\nAmazon Continues Push Into Health Care\\n\\nIn late February, Amazon completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical,\\n\\ngiving it a primary health care provider with in-person and virtual treatment as well\\n\\nas lab tests and programs for preventive care.\\n\\n\\\"We're on a mission to make it dramatically easier for people to \\u0000nd, choose, afford\\n\\nand engage with the services, products, and professionals they need to get and stay\\n\\nhealthy,\\\" said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, in a\\n\\nwritten statement with the Amazon news release.\\n\\nAmazon has made several forays into the health care market. In 2018 Amazon paid\\n\\nabout $1 billion to acquire PillPack. That gave Amazon the ability to ship\\n\\nprescriptions around the country, making it a direct threat to the more than $400\\n\\nbillion pharmacy business.\\n\\nAmazon has long-held ambitions to greatly simplify how consumers receive health\\n\\ncare, but it remains a lofty goal that has yet to emerge as a moneymaking venture.\\n\\nTechnical Analysis Of Amazon Stock\\n\\nIn the stock market, timing is critical. So when you're looking for stocks to buy or\\n\\nsell, it's important to do the fundamental and technical analysis that identi\\u0000es\\n\\nlower-risk entry points that also offer solid potential rewards.\\n\\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that Amazon stock has a weak IBD Composite\\n\\nRating of 36 out of 99. When choosing growth stocks for the biggest potential,\\n\\nbased on technical and fundamental criteria, try to focus on those with a\\n\\nComposite Rating of 90 or higher.\\n\\nAmazon's Relative Strength Rating now stands at 32 out of 99. Ideally, look for\\n\\nstocks with a rating of 80 or higher.\\n\\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy?\\n\\nAMZN is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been\\n\\nrecovering since it hit a low at the start of the year.\\n\\nAMZN stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price\\n\\naction is so far pretty smooth.\\n\\nEven if Amazon breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could\\n\\nretard any advance AMZN tries in the next several months.\\n\\nThe stock continues to hit resistance at the 200-day line, which has been a\\n\\nresistance level for about a year. Amazon is currently sitting on its 50-day line.\\n\\nFalling below that would be reason for caution. But holding above it and then\\n\\npiercing through the 200-day line and holding would be a positive sign.\\n\\nRecognizing stock chart patterns is one key to the investment guidelines. IBD offers\\n\\na broad range of growth stock lists, such as Leaderboard and SwingTrader.\\n\\nInvestors also can create watchlists, \\u0000nd companies nearing a buy point, or develop\\n\\ncustom screens at IBD MarketSmith.\\n\\nIf you're interested in buying large-cap stocks, in these articles you'll \\u0000nd technical\\n\\nanalysis of leading large caps to see if they are in or near a proper buy zone.\\n\\nPlease follow Brian Deagon on Twitter at @IBD_BDeagon for more on tech stocks,\\n\\nanalysis and \\u0000nancial markets.\\n\\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\\n\\nAmazon Makes Its Swan Dive Into ChatGPT Arti\\u0000cial Intelligence Pool\\n\\nNo Silver Lining In Amazon's Cloud Business As Results Fail To Excite\\n\\nAmazon's Alexa Smart Speaker Blazed A Trail, Then Burned Out\\n\\nLooking For Market Insights?

Analysts expected pro\\u0000ts to edge up\\n\\naround 4% to 80 cents per share with revenue totaling $24.22 billion, up 43%\\n\\ncompared with last year.\\n\\nTesla's total gross pro\\u0000t grew 7% to $4.53 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile,\\n\\ntotal gross margins came in at 18.2%, down from 19.3% in Q1 and a decline of 682\\n\\nbasis points vs. last year. Auto gross margins, excluding regulatory credits and\\n\\nleases, came in at 18.1%, down from 18.3% in Q1.\\n\\nThat is below the 20% gross margin \\\"\\u0000oor\\\" Tesla previously targeted. Ahead of\\n\\nearnings, a slew of analysts rang warning bells on gross margins.\\n\\n\\\"The short-term variances in gross margins and pro\\u0000tability really are minor\\n\\nrelative to the long term picture,\\\" Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors during\\n\\nthe Q2 earnings call.\\n\\n\\\"Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly,\\\" he added.\\n\\nStock Falls After Earnings\\n\\nHowever on July 20, TSLA tumbled 9.7% to 262.90, falling below the 21-day line\\n\\nbut only giving up July gains.\\n\\nAhead of earnings, Wood sold tranches of her \\u0000rm's Tesla stock holdings in\\n\\nconsecutive sessions, unloading more than 73,000 shares before the EV giant\\n\\nreported second-quarter \\u0000nancials.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas on July 24 wrote he expects Tesla's full-year\\n\\nauto gross margins to remain below 20% until 2025.\\n\\nCathie Wood sold another 20,700 shares of Tesla stock on July 25 for around $5.49\\n\\nmillion, based on the closing price of 265.28.\\n\\nTesla Stock And Musk\\n\\nThere is never a dull moment for Tesla and Musk, with the two inextricably linked.\\n\\nSince Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 28, purchasing the social media platform for\\n\\n$44 billion, some longtime Tesla stock bulls have worried Musk's focus on Twitter,\\n\\nalong with negative attention, is weighing down Tesla stock.\\n\\nMusk appeared to lessen those fears when he hired Linda Yaccarino,\\n\\nNBCUniversal's advertising chief, as the new CEO for X Corp., formerly known as\\n\\nTwitter. The Tesla chief added Yaccarino will focus on business operations while he\\n\\nwill work on product design and new technology.\\n\\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote the news ends some of the \\\"distraction risk\\n\\naround the Tesla story.\\\"\\n\\nWith TSLA shares pulling back after earnings, the top question for investors is\\n\\nalways, when is it a good time to buy or sell Tesla stock.\\n\\nTesla and Musk are betting big on the Cybertruck and autonomous vehicle\\n\\ntechnology, along with a possible tailwind from the In\\u0000ation Reduction Act (IRA).\\n\\nTesla A Monster Stock Over Much Of Its History\\n\\nAlmost single-handedly, Musk has turned the auto industry on its head, essentially\\n\\nforcing it to get aboard the electric-vehicle train.\\n\\nIt's a reason why Tesla has been a monster stock over much of its history, especially\\n\\nduring its stratospheric run from mid-2019 to late 2021. The stock hit a bear\\n\\nmarket low of 101.84 on Jan. 6, but roared back until Q1 earnings.\\n\\nOn April 19, Tesla reported a big \\u0000rst-quarter earnings decline while revenue\\n\\nmissed views. Pro\\u0000t margins for the global EV giant also fell below 20% as the\\n\\ncompany executed an aggressive price-slashing strategy in the \\u0000rst part of 2023.\\n\\nTesla reported revenue increasing 24% to $23.33 billion with EPS of 85 cents, a\\n\\n20% decline compared to 2022.\\n\\nThe EV company's total gross pro\\u0000t came in at $4.5 billion, with Tesla's pro\\u0000t gross\\n\\nmargin at 19.3%, down from 23.8% in Q4 and 29.1% a year earlier.\\n\\nTesla's Global Price Cutting Strategy\\n\\nTesla has slashed prices worldwide multiple times in 2023, starting in January and\\n\\ncontinuing into April. The only exception is China, where Tesla cut prices\\n\\nsigni\\u0000cantly in late October before the reductions in early January.\\n\\nOn April 14, Tesla reduced prices in several European markets. Tesla also dropped\\n\\nthe price of its electric vehicles in Israel and Singapore in order to increase demand,\\n\\nexpanding a worldwide discount push that began in China in January.\\n\\nThe global EV maker also signi\\u0000cantly reduced prices in the U.S. and Europe on Jan.\\n\\n13, then reduced European prices again in early March.\\n\\nIn Germany, Tesla lowered the price of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by between\\n\\n4.5% and 9.8%, while it cut prices of the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Singapore\\n\\nbetween 4.3% and 5%.\\n\\nHowever, more recently Tesla raised Model S and Model X vehicle prices in China\\n\\nby around $2,750. That follows a $290 price hike in China on the Model 3 and\\n\\nModel Y. The global EV giant also increased prices on its two popular vehicles in\\n\\nother markets including the U.S.\\n\\nTesla Stock: Betting On Autonomous Vehicles And The Cybertruck\\n\\nMusk has long touted Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and the potential\\n\\nvalue it brings to the brand.\\n\\nThe Tesla CEO told investors during the Q1 earnings call the \\\"value of a car that is\\n\\nautonomous is enormous.\\\"\\n\\nMusk also stressed that improvements in the FSD beta are \\\"really quite dramatic.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The trend is very clearly toward full autonomy, and I hesitate to say this, but I think\\n\\nwe'll do it this year,\\\" Musk said, referring to self-driving vehicles.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Musk has con\\u0000rmed that a Cybertruck delivery event will take place\\n\\nlater in 2023.\\n\\nTesla reported in its Q2 \\u0000nancials the Cybertruck \\\"remains on track to begin initial\\n\\nproduction later this year at Gigafactory Texas.\\\" However, the EV giant added it is\\n\\n\\\"testing Cybertruck vehicles around the world for \\u0000nal certi\\u0000cation and validation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We can't wait to start delivering it later this year,\\\" Musk told investors Wednesday,\\n\\nreferring to the Cybertruck.\\n\\nOn July 15, Tesla tweeted a photo of the \\u0000rst Tesla Cybertruck made at its Austin\\n\\nplant. Tesla stock responded jumping 3.2%.\\n\\nThe company also said it continues to \\\"make progress\\\" on its next generation\\n\\nplatform. Since the Tesla investor day in early March, the company has remained\\n\\nmostly silent on its next generation vehicle, to be produced at its new plant in\\n\\nMexico. At the annual shareholder meeting, Tesla unveiled a vehicle silhouette.\\n\\nThe Long-Awaited Semi Hauler Unveiled\\n\\nIn early December, Tesla unveiled its long-awaited Semi, an 18-wheel, long-haul\\n\\nelectric freight truck, \\u0000ve years after it was \\u0000rst announced. However, in March,\\n\\nTesla ordered a voluntary recall of 35 Semi trucks due to a parking brake issue.\\n\\nTesla began delivering its long-haul Semi trucks to PepsiCo (PEP) in December.\\n\\nFurther, Musk has indicated there are plans to build out a charging network for\\n\\nlong-haul trucks.\\n\\nMusk did not specify how much the eighteen-wheeler costs. The Semi is capable of\\n\\ntraveling an estimated 500 miles per charge. It can accelerate from zero to 60 in 20\\n\\nseconds, Tesla says. The company expects to ramp production over the next year\\n\\nand aims to deliver 50,000 units in 2024.\\n\\nBefore the recall, PepsiCo planned to deploy 36 Tesla Semi trucks, with 15 in\\n\\nModesto and 21 in Sacramento.\\n\\nPepsi placed its order for 100 EVs when the Semi was \\u0000rst announced in 2017.\\n\\nTesla is currently under investigation by National Highway Traf\\u0000c Safety\\n\\nAdministration over possible seat belt failures.

The\\n\\nchip giant is seen as one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. Is Nvidia stock a buy\\n\\nright now, with earnings due?\\n\\nSemiconductor, AI News\\n\\nIn May, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang announced a new supercomputer,\\n\\nsoftware and services for generative AI (arti\\u0000cial intelligence). Generative AI can\\n\\ncreate content, including written articles, from simple descriptive phrases by\\n\\nanalyzing and digesting vast amounts of data. It can also write computer\\n\\nprogramming code.\\n\\nFor its latest quarter, graphics-chip maker Nvidia crushed Wall Street's targets on\\n\\nrecord data-center sales. Production is ramping up to meet huge demand for AI\\n\\ntechnology, CEO Huang said.\\n\\nNvidia is a leader in AI chips. In the tech industry's \\u0000erce battle for AI dominance,\\n\\nthe advanced chips needed for generative AI, such as the ChatGPT chatbot, are key.\\n\\nFor those looking for top large-cap stocks to buy now, here's a dive into NVDA\\n\\nstock.\\n\\nNvidia Stock Technical Analysis\\n\\nNvidia rebounded Aug. 3 after three down days, technically regaining a 439.90 buy\\n\\npoint. Shares edged higher on Aug. 4. The latest entry from a three-weeks-tight\\n\\npattern offered a place for existing investors to add a few more shares. The buy\\n\\nrange goes to 461.90, the IBD Leaderboard stock analysis shows.\\n\\nBut with the market rally shifting to under pressure, investors may want to wait to\\n\\nsee if Nvidia can \\u0000nd support at the 50-day/10-week line for the \\u0000rst time since\\n\\nearly January.\\n\\nA rebound from those levels would offer a buying opportunity. But shares aren't\\n\\nthere yet.\\n\\nA further pullback also could be part of a full-\\u0000edged base.\\n\\nShares still aren't far from the 52-week high, set on July 14.\\n\\nNVDA joined the prestigious IBD Leaderboard in February on an earnings gap-up. It\\n\\nsurged again in May on blowout earnings and strong guidance.\\n\\nYear to date, Nvidia stock has skyrocketed 206%, after crashing in 2022.\\n\\nThe relative strength line is \\u0000attening out a bit after a strong rally, the IBD\\n\\nMarketSmith charts show. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the\\n\\nS&P 500. It is the blue line in the chart shown.\\n\\nNVDA earns an IBD Composite Rating of 97, out of a best-possible 99. In other\\n\\nwords, Nvidia stock is in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of technical and\\n\\nfundamental metrics.\\n\\nNVIDIA (NVDA)\\n\\n$454.17 7.37 1.65%\\n\\nDec 20\\n\\nMar 21\\n\\nJun 21\\n\\nSep 21\\n\\nDec 21\\n\\nMar 22\\n\\nJun 22\\n\\nSep 22\\n\\nDec 22\\n\\nMar 23\\n\\nJu\\n\\n08/07/2023 (Market Close)\\n\\nInvestors generally should focus on stocks with Comp Ratings of 90 or even 95 and\\n\\nabove. Nvidia stock often earns a spot on the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Sector\\n\\nLeaders lists.\\n\\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that NVDA carries a Relative Strength Rating\\n\\nof 99. That means it has outperformed 99% of all other stocks over the past year.\\n\\nThe iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) holds both Nvidia stock and AMD\\n\\nstock.\\n\\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis\\n\\nNvidia Earnings\\n\\nNvidia's EPS Rating is 68 out of 99 and its SMR Rating is a B, on a scale of A to a\\n\\nworst E. The EPS rating compares a company's earnings growth to other stocks. Its\\n\\nSMR Rating gauges sales growth, pro\\u0000t margins and return on equity.\\n\\nOn May 24, the chip giant delivered a big beat-and-raise report. The Nvidia\\n\\nearnings report included a bullish, AI-fueled sales forecast.\\n\\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned $1.09 a share on sales of $7.19 billion\\n\\nin the quarter ended April 30. Year over year, Nvidia earnings dropped 20% while\\n\\nsales fell 13%. But the results easily outpaced Wall Street's expectations.\\n\\nIn Q1, data-center sales rose 14% to $4.28 billion. Gaming-chip sales fell 38% to\\n\\n$2.24 billion.\\n\\nAnalysts expect Nvidia earnings per share to rebound 138% in \\u0000scal 2024, on a 61%\\n\\nsales gain. Last year, Nvidia earnings fell 25%.\\n\\nIts next quarterly report is expected on Aug. 23.\\n\\nOut of 50 analysts covering NVDA stock, 43 rate it a buy.

Start With These 3 Steps\\n\\nNVDA Backstory, Rivals\\n\\nThe fabless chipmaker pioneered graphics processing units, or GPUs, to make video\\n\\ngames more realistic. It's expanding in AI chips, used in supercomputers, data\\n\\ncenters and drug development.\\n\\nNvidia's GPUs act as accelerators for central processing units, or CPUs, made by\\n\\nother companies. It's working on \\\"supercomputers\\\" combining its own CPUs and\\n\\nGPUs.\\n\\nIn addition, Nvidia chips are used for Bitcoin mining and self-driving electric cars.\\n\\nNvidia has made a big push into metaverse applications.\\n\\nFabless chip stocks include Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Monolithic\\n\\nPower Systems (MPWR).\\n\\nCurrently, the fabless group ranks No. 2 out of 197 industry groups. Fabless\\n\\ncompanies design the hardware while outsourcing the manufacturing to a third-\\n\\nparty \\u0000rm.\\n\\nFor the best returns, investors should focus on companies that are leading the\\n\\nmarket and their own industry group.\\n\\nIs Nvidia Stock A Buy?\\n\\nOn a fundamental level, Nvidia earnings are expected to return to growth. They\\n\\nshould more than double this \\u0000scal year, driven by booming chip sales for data\\n\\ncenters and arti\\u0000cial intelligence.\\n\\nThe fabless chipmaker is expanding in other growth areas such as automated\\n\\nelectric cars and cloud gaming as well. The adoption of the metaverse and\\n\\ncryptocurrencies could further stoke demand for Nvidia chips.\\n\\nHowever, macroeconomic uncertainties and risk of global recession linger.\\n\\nNVDA stock has staged a massive comeback, more than tripling in 2023 so far.\\n\\nShares have reclaimed their latest follow-on entry after a retreat and are now back\\n\\nin a proper buy zone. But investors may want to wait for a pullback to key levels or a\\n\\nnew base, especially with the market rally under pressure.\\n\\nBottom line: Nvidia stock is a buy right now, but with caveats.\\n\\nAs a leading chip company with exposure to top end-markets, Nvidia is always one\\n\\nto watch.\\n\\nCheck out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to \\u0000nd dozens of the best stocks\\n\\nto buy or watch.\\n\\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\\n\\nIs AMD Stock A Buy?\\n\\nSee The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch\\n\\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmith\\n\\nJoin IBD Live And Learn Top Chart-Reading And Trading Techniques From The\\n\\nPros\\n\\nTECHNOLOGY\\n\\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy As It Restructures Workforce In Tough Times?\\n\\nBRIAN DEAGON 03:03 PM ET 04/14/2023\\n\\nF or years, Amazon seemed invincible, an e-commerce giant that made other\\n\\ncompanies shiver when it muscled into their markets. It helped Amazon stock soar\\n\\ninto four-digit territory, and the company's earnings reports often delighted\\n\\ninvestors.\\n\\nNow, after a year of troubling earnings reports, Amazon has launched a major\\n\\nrestructuring, including plans to cut 27,000 employees from its workforce. Is\\n\\nAmazon stock a buy?\\n\\nIn late March, Amazon announced plans to slash 9,000 jobs. That's on top of the\\n\\n18,000 job cuts it announced in January.\\n\\n\\\"Given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in\\n\\nthe near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and head\\n\\ncount,\\\" Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in a written notice to employees\\n\\nwhen the layoffs were announced. He also suggested more layoffs are possible. The\\n\\ncuts mainly focus on Amazon Web Services, advertising, Twitch, human resources\\n\\nand its stores divisions.\\n\\nAmazon Jumps Into Arti\\u0000cial Intelligence\\n\\nOn April 13, Amazon jumped into the booming \\u0000eld of generative arti\\u0000cial\\n\\nintelligence, the technology behind ChatGPT. Amazon stock climbed on the news,\\n\\nas did other AI companies.\\n\\nAlphabet and Microsoft (MSFT) previously announced plans to bring ChatGPT to\\n\\nthe public. Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services,\\n\\nplans to target corporate customers.\\n\\nAWS will also expand access to custom-made chips. They say the chips can run AI\\n\\nsoftware more ef\\u0000ciently and cheaper than competitors can.\\n\\n\\\"Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades. But\\n\\nit's only been the last \\u0000ve to 10 years that it's started to be used more pervasively\\n\\nby companies,\\\" Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in his letter to shareholders.\\n\\nMachine learning is a form of arti\\u0000cial intelligence.\\n\\nJassy went on to say: \\\"We will continue to invest substantially in these models\\n\\nacross all of our consumer, seller, brand and creator experience.\\\"\\n\\nThe three largest cloud computing companies, AWS, Microsoft and Google, have\\n\\nmoved AI development to the top of their to-do list. Each is trying to capitalize on\\n\\nthe booming interest in arti\\u0000cial intelligence technology.\\n\\nA Heightened Focus On Cost Savings\\n\\nAfter the second round of job cuts, Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA,\\n\\nmaintained a buy rating on Amazon stock.\\n\\n\\\"While some may view these job cuts as a sign of a gloomier macro outlook,\\n\\nespecially as it relates to cloud computing and digital advertising, we believe\\n\\ninvestors will appreciate Amazon's heightened focus on cost savings and free cash\\n\\n\\u0000ow,\\\" Sundaram wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nThe most recent layoff announcements, in March, came after Amazon announced\\n\\nfourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. The company beat on revenue but missed on\\n\\nearnings, as its typically strong cloud computing unit failed to rescue the e-\\n\\ncommerce giant.\\n\\nThe cloud unit showed that revenue decelerated. AWS sales jumped 20% to $21.4\\n\\nbillion, but that was below expectations and a deceleration from 27% growth in the\\n\\nprior quarter\\n\\nOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said more cost-cutting efforts are needed.\\n\\n\\\"We believe more layoffs are necessary for e-commerce to become meaningfully\\n\\npro\\u0000table,\\\" he said in his note to clients.\\n\\nAmazon Continues Push Into Health Care\\n\\nIn late February, Amazon completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical,\\n\\ngiving it a primary health care provider with in-person and virtual treatment as well\\n\\nas lab tests and programs for preventive care.\\n\\n\\\"We're on a mission to make it dramatically easier for people to \\u0000nd, choose, afford\\n\\nand engage with the services, products, and professionals they need to get and stay\\n\\nhealthy,\\\" said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, in a\\n\\nwritten statement with the Amazon news release.\\n\\nAmazon has made several forays into the health care market. In 2018 Amazon paid\\n\\nabout $1 billion to acquire PillPack. That gave Amazon the ability to ship\\n\\nprescriptions around the country, making it a direct threat to the more than $400\\n\\nbillion pharmacy business.\\n\\nAmazon has long-held ambitions to greatly simplify how consumers receive health\\n\\ncare, but it remains a lofty goal that has yet to emerge as a moneymaking venture.\\n\\nTechnical Analysis Of Amazon Stock\\n\\nIn the stock market, timing is critical. So when you're looking for stocks to buy or\\n\\nsell, it's important to do the fundamental and technical analysis that identi\\u0000es\\n\\nlower-risk entry points that also offer solid potential rewards.\\n\\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that Amazon stock has a weak IBD Composite\\n\\nRating of 36 out of 99. When choosing growth stocks for the biggest potential,\\n\\nbased on technical and fundamental criteria, try to focus on those with a\\n\\nComposite Rating of 90 or higher.\\n\\nAmazon's Relative Strength Rating now stands at 32 out of 99. Ideally, look for\\n\\nstocks with a rating of 80 or higher.\\n\\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy?\\n\\nAMZN is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been\\n\\nrecovering since it hit a low at the start of the year.\\n\\nAMZN stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price\\n\\naction is so far pretty smooth.\\n\\nEven if Amazon breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could\\n\\nretard any advance AMZN tries in the next several months.\\n\\nThe stock continues to hit resistance at the 200-day line, which has been a\\n\\nresistance level for about a year. Amazon is currently sitting on its 50-day line.\\n\\nFalling below that would be reason for caution. But holding above it and then\\n\\npiercing through the 200-day line and holding would be a positive sign.\\n\\nRecognizing stock chart patterns is one key to the investment guidelines. IBD offers\\n\\na broad range of growth stock lists, such as Leaderboard and SwingTrader.\\n\\nInvestors also can create watchlists, \\u0000nd companies nearing a buy point, or develop\\n\\ncustom screens at IBD MarketSmith.\\n\\nIf you're interested in buying large-cap stocks, in these articles you'll \\u0000nd technical\\n\\nanalysis of leading large caps to see if they are in or near a proper buy zone.\\n\\nPlease follow Brian Deagon on Twitter at @IBD_BDeagon for more on tech stocks,\\n\\nanalysis and \\u0000nancial markets.\\n\\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\\n\\nAmazon Makes Its Swan Dive Into ChatGPT Arti\\u0000cial Intelligence Pool\\n\\nNo Silver Lining In Amazon's Cloud Business As Results Fail To Excite\\n\\nAmazon's Alexa Smart Speaker Blazed A Trail, Then Burned Out\\n\\nLooking For Market Insights?
