       "\" \\nTesla stock has been a monster stock over much of its history, especially during its stratospheric run from mid-2019 to late 2021. The stock hit a bear market low of 101.84 on Jan. 6, but roared back until Q1 earnings. Nvidia is seen as one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. Nvidia stock has skyrocketed 206% year to date, after crashing in 2022. Nvidia is a leader in AI chips. In the tech industry's fierce battle for AI dominance, the advanced chips needed for generative AI, such as the ChatGPT chatbot, are key. However, Nvidia stock is not a buy at this time. It's still in a long-term downtrend but has been recovering since it hit a low at the start of the year. Nvidia stock is now forming a cup base with a 114.10 buy point, and the price action is so far pretty smooth. Even if Nvidia breaks out, it has a mountain to climb back. Overhead supply could retard any advance Nvidia tries in the next several months. Tesla stock is greatly extended from a cup base with a 207.79 buy point. Shares have climbed 118% so far in 2023,\""
