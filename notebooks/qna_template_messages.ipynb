Analysts expected pro\\u0000ts to edge up\\n\\naround 4% to 80 cents per share with revenue totaling $24.22 billion, up 43%\\n\\ncompared with last year.\\n\\nTesla's total gross pro\\u0000t grew 7% to $4.53 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile,\\n\\ntotal gross margins came in at 18.2%, down from 19.3% in Q1 and a decline of 682\\n\\nbasis points vs. last year. Auto gross margins, excluding regulatory credits and\\n\\nleases, came in at 18.1%, down from 18.3% in Q1.\\n\\nThat is below the 20% gross margin \\\"\\u0000oor\\\" Tesla previously targeted. Ahead of\\n\\nearnings, a slew of analysts rang warning bells on gross margins.\\n\\n\\\"The short-term variances in gross margins and pro\\u0000tability really are minor\\n\\nrelative to the long term picture,\\\" Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors during\\n\\nthe Q2 earnings call.\\n\\n\\\"Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly,\\\" he added.\\n\\nStock Falls After Earnings\\n\\nHowever on July 20, TSLA tumbled 9.7% to 262.90, falling below the 21-day line\\n\\nbut only giving up July gains.\\n\\nAhead of earnings, Wood sold tranches of her \\u0000rm's Tesla stock holdings in\\n\\nconsecutive sessions, unloading more than 73,000 shares before the EV giant\\n\\nreported second-quarter \\u0000nancials.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas on July 24 wrote he expects Tesla's full-year\\n\\nsales gain.

They\\n\\nshould more than double this \\u0000scal year, driven by booming chip sales for data\\n\\ncenters and arti\\u0000cial intelligence.\\n\\nThe fabless chipmaker is expanding in other growth areas such as automated\\n\\nelectric cars and cloud gaming as well. The adoption of the metaverse and\\n\\ncryptocurrencies could further stoke demand for Nvidia chips.\\n\\nHowever, macroeconomic uncertainties and risk of global recession linger.\\n\\nNVDA stock has staged a massive comeback, more than tripling in 2023 so far.\\n\\nShares have reclaimed their latest follow-on entry after a retreat and are now back\\n\\nin a proper buy zone.

Analysts expected pro\\u0000ts to edge up\\n\\naround 4% to 80 cents per share with revenue totaling $24.22 billion, up 43%\\n\\ncompared with last year.\\n\\nTesla's total gross pro\\u0000t grew 7% to $4.53 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile,\\n\\ntotal gross margins came in at 18.2%, down from 19.3% in Q1 and a decline of 682\\n\\nbasis points vs. last year. Auto gross margins, excluding regulatory credits and\\n\\nleases, came in at 18.1%, down from 18.3% in Q1.\\n\\nThat is below the 20% gross margin \\\"\\u0000oor\\\" Tesla previously targeted. Ahead of\\n\\nearnings, a slew of analysts rang warning bells on gross margins.\\n\\n\\\"The short-term variances in gross margins and pro\\u0000tability really are minor\\n\\nrelative to the long term picture,\\\" Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors during\\n\\nthe Q2 earnings call.\\n\\n\\\"Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly,\\\" he added.\\n\\nStock Falls After Earnings\\n\\nHowever on July 20, TSLA tumbled 9.7% to 262.90, falling below the 21-day line\\n\\nbut only giving up July gains.\\n\\nAhead of earnings, Wood sold tranches of her \\u0000rm's Tesla stock holdings in\\n\\nconsecutive sessions, unloading more than 73,000 shares before the EV giant\\n\\nreported second-quarter \\u0000nancials.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas on July 24 wrote he expects Tesla's full-year\\n\\nsales gain. Last year, Nvidia earnings fell 25%.\\n\\nIts next quarterly report is expected on Aug. 23.\\n\\nOut of 50 analysts covering NVDA stock, 43 rate it a buy. Six have a hold and one\\n\\nhas a sell, according to FactSet.\\n\\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners? Start With These 3 Steps\\n\\nNVDA Backstory, Rivals\\n\\nThe fabless chipmaker pioneered graphics processing units, or GPUs, to make video\\n\\ngames more realistic. It's expanding in AI chips, used in supercomputers, data\\n\\ncenters and drug development.\\n\\nNvidia's GPUs act as accelerators for central processing units, or CPUs, made by\\n\\nother companies. It's working on \\\"supercomputers\\\" combining its own CPUs and\\n\\nGPUs.\\n\\nIn addition, Nvidia chips are used for Bitcoin mining and self-driving electric cars.\\n\\nNvidia has made a big push into metaverse applications.\\n\\nFabless chip stocks include Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Monolithic\\n\\nPower Systems (MPWR).\\n\\nCurrently, the fabless group ranks No. 2 out of 197 industry groups. Fabless\\n\\ncompanies design the hardware while outsourcing the manufacturing to a third-\\n\\nparty \\u0000rm.\\n\\nFor the best returns, investors should focus on companies that are leading the\\n\\nmarket and their own industry group.\\n\\nIs Nvidia Stock A Buy?\\n\\nOn a fundamental level, Nvidia earnings are expected to return to growth. They\\n\\nshould more than double this \\u0000scal year, driven by booming chip sales for data\\n\\ncenters and arti\\u0000cial intelligence.\\n\\nThe fabless chipmaker is expanding in other growth areas such as automated\\n\\nelectric cars and cloud gaming as well. The adoption of the metaverse and\\n\\ncryptocurrencies could further stoke demand for Nvidia chips.\\n\\nHowever, macroeconomic uncertainties and risk of global recession linger.\\n\\nNVDA stock has staged a massive comeback, more than tripling in 2023 so far.\\n\\nShares have reclaimed their latest follow-on entry after a retreat and are now back\\n\\nin a proper buy zone. But investors may want to wait for a pullback to key levels or a\\n\\nnew base, especially with the market rally under pressure.\\n\\nBottom line: Nvidia stock is a buy right now, but with caveats.\\n\\nAs a leading chip company with exposure to top end-markets, Nvidia is always one\\n\\nto watch.\\n\\nCheck out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to \\u0000nd dozens of the best stocks\\n\\nto buy or watch.\\n\\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\\n\\nIs AMD Stock A Buy?\\n\\nSee The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch\\n\\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmith\\n\\nJoin IBD Live And Learn Top Chart-Reading And Trading Techniques From The\\n\\nPros\\n\\nTSLA stock is greatly extended from a cup base with a 207.79 buy point.
