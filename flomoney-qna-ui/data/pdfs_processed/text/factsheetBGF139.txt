MAY 2023 FACTSHEET
SUSTAINABILITY CHARACTERISTICS
Sustainability Characteristics can help investors integrate non-financial, sustainability considerations into their investment process. 
These metrics enable investors to evaluate funds based on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities. 
This analysis can provide insight into the effective management and long-term financial prospects of a fund.
The metrics below have been provided for transparency and informational purposes only. The existence of an ESG rating is not 
indicative of how or whether ESG factors will be integrated into a fund. The metrics are based on MSCI ESG Fund Ratings and, unless 
otherwise stated in fund documentation and included within a fund’s investment objective, do not change a fund’s investment objective 
or constrain the fund’s investable universe, and there is no indication that an ESG or Impact focused investment strategy or 
exclusionary screens will be adopted by a fund. For more information regarding a fund's investment strategy, please see the fund's 
prospectus.

All data is from MSCI ESG Fund Ratings as of 19-May-2023, based on holdings as of 31-Dec-2022. As such, the fund’s sustainable 
characteristics may differ from MSCI ESG Fund Ratings from time to time.
To be included in MSCI ESG Fund Ratings, 65% (or 50% for bond funds and money market funds) of the fund’s gross weight must 
come from securities with ESG coverage by MSCI ESG Research (certain cash positions and other asset types deemed not relevant 
for ESG analysis by MSCI are removed prior to calculating a fund’s gross weight; the absolute values of short positions are included but 
treated as uncovered), the fund’s holdings date must be less than one year old, and the fund must have at least ten securities.
ESG GLOSSARY:
MSCI ESG Fund Rating (AAA-CCC): The MSCI ESG Rating is calculated as a direct mapping of ESG Quality Scores to letter rating categories (e.g. AAA = 8.6-10). The ESG
Ratings range from leader (AAA, AA), average (A, BBB, BB) to laggard (B, CCC).
MSCI ESG Quality Score - Peer Percentile: The fund’s ESG Percentile compared to its Lipper peer group.
Fund Lipper Global Classification: The fund peer group as defined by the Lipper Global Classification.
Funds in Peer Group: The number of funds from the relevant Lipper Global Classification peer group that are also in ESG coverage.
MSCI ESG Quality Score (0-10): The MSCI ESG Quality Score (0 - 10) for funds is calculated using the weighted average of the ESG scores of fund holdings. MSCI rates
underlying holdings according to their exposure to industry specific ESG risks and their ability to manage those risks relative to peers.
MSCI ESG % Coverage: Percentage of the fund’s holdings for which the MSCI ESG ratings data is available.  The MSCI ESG Fund Rating, MSCI ESG Quality Score and
MSCI ESG Quality Score – Peer Percentile metrics are displayed for funds with at least 65% coverage (or 50% for bond funds and money market funds).
MSCI  Weighted  Average  Carbon  Intensity  (Tons  CO2E/$M  SALES):  Measures  a  fund's  exposure  to  carbon  intensive  companies.  This  figure  represents  the  estimated
greenhouse gas emissions per $1 million in sales across the fund’s holdings. This allows for comparisons between funds of different sizes.
MSCI Weighted Average Carbon Intensity % Coverage: Percentage of the fund's holdings for which MSCI Carbon Intensity data is available. The MSCI Weighted Average
Carbon Intensity metric is displayed for funds with any coverage. Funds with low coverage may not fully represent the fund’s carbon characteristics given the lack of coverage.
