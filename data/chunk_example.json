MSCI rates\nunderlying holdings according to their exposure to industry specific ESG risks and their ability to manage those risks relative to peers.\nMSCI ESG % Coverage: Percentage of the fund’s holdings for which the MSCI ESG ratings data is available. The MSCI ESG Fund Rating, MSCI ESG Quality Score and\nMSCI ESG Quality Score – Peer Percentile metrics are displayed for funds with at least 65% coverage (or 50% for bond funds and money market funds).\nMSCI Weighted Average Carbon Intensity (Tons CO2E/$M SALES): Measures a fund's exposure to carbon intensive companies. This figure represents the estimated\ngreenhouse gas emissions per $1 million in sales across the fund’s holdings. This allows for comparisons between funds of different sizes.\nMSCI Weighted Average Carbon Intensity % Coverage: Percentage of the fund's holdings for which MSCI Carbon Intensity data is available. The MSCI Weighted Average\nCarbon Intensity metric is displayed for funds with any coverage. Funds with low coverage may not fully represent the fund’s carbon characteristics given the lack of coverage.",
